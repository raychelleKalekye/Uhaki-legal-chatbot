How is compulsory acquisition handled under the law? in practice,Land Act,75,"Compulsory acquisition under Kenyan law is handled through a structured process outlined in the **Land Act** and other relevant legal frameworks. Here is a summary of how it is managed: 1. **Notice of Intention to Acquire**: The Commission must first publish a notice of intention to acquire the land. This notice must be published in a manner that ensures it reaches all interested parties. The notice must specify the date on which possession of the land and title will vest in the national or county government. 2. **Formal Taking of Possession**: After the award has been made, the Commission may take formal possession of the land by serving a notice on all interested parties. This notice must state that possession and title will vest in the national or county government. The taking of possession must not result in persons being rendered homeless. 3. **Urgent Necessity**: In cases of urgent necessity where delay would be contrary to public interest, the Commission may take possession of the land after fifteen days from the date of publication of the notice of intention to acquire. This process bypasses some of the normal procedures but still requires compliance with the prescribed timeline. 4. **Compensation**: The Commission is required to pay compensation to the landowners. The form of compensation can be elected by the landowner. However, compensation is not payable to a public body unless there is a demonstrable inference that the land was purchased and developed by that public body. 5. **Effect on Plant and Machinery**: If plant or machinery is attached to the land, the interested party may serve a notice to the Commission requesting the removal of such assets before the acquisition process begins. This notice must be given after the notice of intention to acquire the land has been published and not later than fifteen days before the inquiry under  112(1). 6. **Public Purpose**: Land may be compulsorily acquired if the Commission certifies that it is required for public purposes or in the public interest, as necessary for the stated public purpose. 7. **Tribunal and Appeals**: Matters relating to compulsory acquisition are referred to the Tribunal, which has the power to confirm, vary, or quash the Commission's decision. A party dissatisfied with the Tribunal's decision may appeal to the court on grounds such as the decision being contrary to law or procedural defects. 8. **Lapse of Acquisition**: If the acquisition process is not completed within twenty-four months from the date of publication of the notice of intention to acquire the land, the acquisition shall lapse.

Who is entitled to relief concerning charges and mortgages? for an employer,Land Act,79,"The question appears to conflate two distinct legal areas: relief concerning charges and mortgages, and the rights of an employer in the context of employment law. Based on the provided context: 1. **Relief concerning charges and mortgages** is addressed in **[3] Land Act - Application for relief by chargor** and **[4] Land Act - Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs**. These provisions outline that **the chargor** (the person who created the charge or mortgage) may apply for relief against the exercise of remedies by the chargee (the lender or mortgagee). Relief may also be sought by **joint chargors**, **spouses** (in certain circumstances), or **bankruptcy trustees** if the chargor has been adjudged bankrupt. 2. **Employer-related rights** are addressed in **[2] Employment Act - Repayment of remuneration wrongfully withheld or deducted** and **[5] Employment Act - Debts to which Part applies**. These provisions relate to **employees** and their rights regarding the repayment of wages or compensation, not to relief concerning charges or mortgages. ### Conclusion: **No legal provision in the provided context directly addresses who is entitled to relief concerning charges and mortgages for an employer.** The available information does not clarify whether an employer can be a chargor or whether they are entitled to relief in the context of charges or mortgages.

What happens when default by chargor arises? for a public authority,Land Act,90,"When a default by the chargor arises, the chargee may exercise remedies under the Land Act, including the power to sell the charged land. If the charged land is public land, the chargee must serve a notice to sell in the prescribed form and ensure that the notice is served on the Commission, as specified in  90(3)(a) of the Land Act. Before proceeding to sell the land, the chargee must wait at least forty days from the date of service of the notice to sell. Additionally, the court may refuse to grant an order for the sale if it appears that the default has been remedied, the threat to the security has been removed, or the chargor has taken the steps required by the notice served under  90.

In other words, while an accomplice's testimony is admissible, it must be corroborated by other evidence to ensure the reliability of the conviction.

Who is entitled to relief concerning intermeddling with estate? for an employer,Law of Succession Act,45,"The question regarding ""relief concerning intermeddling with estate"" for an employer is not directly addressed in the provided legal context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the **dependants of a deceased employee** may be entitled to relief concerning intermeddling with the estate, particularly in the context of compensation payments under the **Work Injury Benefits Act**. Specifically, under **[3] Work Injury Benefits Act - Payment of compensation**, it is stated that on the death of an employee, the unpaid balance of any compensation awarded to the employee does not form part of the employee’s estate and shall be paid to the employee’s dependants as specified in the Third Schedule.

What remedies are available in relation to types of marriages? on appeal,Marriage Act,6,"Based on the provided context, the remedies available in relation to types of marriages on appeal are as follows: 1. **Appeal against a decision to permit a marriage ceremony**: A marriage ceremony may not be performed until any appeal that has been made against a decision of the Registrar to permit the marriage ceremony to be performed is heard and determined. This indicates that there is a procedural remedy available to challenge the Registrar's decision to allow the marriage to proceed. 2. **Annulment of a marriage**: A party to a marriage may petition the court to annul the marriage on specific grounds, such as lack of consummation, prohibited relationships, bigamy, lack of free consent, absence of a party, pregnancy without the husband's knowledge, or insanity without the petitioner's knowledge. The court may grant annulment if the petition is made within one year of the marriage, the petitioner was ignorant of the facts, and the marriage has not been consummated since the petition was made. 3. **Dissolution of a Christian marriage**: A party to a Christian marriage may petition the court for dissolution on grounds such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, exceptional depravity, or irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. 4. **Dissolution of a customary marriage**: A party to a customary marriage may petition the court for dissolution on grounds such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, exceptional depravity, irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, or any valid ground under the customary law of the petitioner. The Cabinet Secretary may make regulations for the implementation of these grounds. 5. **Dissolution of a Hindu marriage**: Although the context does not provide specific details on Hindu marriages, it is implied that dissolution may be available under similar grounds as customary marriages, subject to applicable laws and regulations.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to separation? at registration,Marriage Act,64,"The safeguards that exist to protect rights relating to separation, as outlined in the context, include: 1. **Right to Parental Care and Protection**: Every child has the right to parental care and protection, and this right includes the right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with the parent or parents on a regular basis, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that such contact is not in the best interest of the child. 2. **Best Interests of the Child**: The best interests of the child are of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child. This principle guides decisions regarding separation and ensures that the child's welfare is the primary consideration. 3. **Alternative Care**: If a child is separated from his or her parents, the child shall be provided with the best alternative care available, giving priority to family-based alternative care. 4. **Separation of Siblings**: Where an order applies to two or more siblings, the order shall ensure that the siblings are placed under care and protection together and may not be separated, except for compelling reasons recorded by the Court. 5. **Reunification**: If a child is separated from his or her parent or parents without the consent of the parent or parents, the Secretary shall facilitate the tracing and reunification of the child with the parent or parents upon request.

How is annulment handled under the law? in practice,Marriage Act,69,"Annulment under Kenyan law, as outlined in the Marriage Act, is a legal process that declares a marriage null and void from its inception, as if it never existed. Here's how annulment is handled in practice: 1. **Grounds for Annulment**: A party to a marriage may petition the court to annul the marriage on specific grounds, including: - The marriage has not been consummated. - One of the parties was in a prohibited relationship at the time of the marriage. - One of the parties was already married to another person at the time of the marriage. - The petitioner’s consent was not freely given. - One of the parties was absent at the time of the marriage. - The wife was pregnant at the time of the marriage, and the husband is not responsible for the pregnancy. - One of the parties suffers from recurrent bouts of insanity at the time of the marriage, without the petitioner's knowledge. 2. **Time Limit for Petition**: The petition for annulment must be made within one year of the celebration of the marriage. This is a strict time limit, and the court will not entertain petitions beyond this period. 3. **Effect of Annulment**: Once a decree of annulment is granted, the parties are deemed never to have been married. However, the annulment does not: - Render lawful anything done unlawfully during the marriage or render unlawful anything done lawfully. - Affect the competence of either party as a witness in respect of anything done during the marriage. - Relieve either party of any debt properly incurred on behalf of the other during the marriage. 4. **Registration of Decrees**: If a decree of annulment is granted by a Kenyan court, a certified copy of the decree must be delivered to the Registrar. The Registrar will then register the annulment in a register maintained for this purpose. 5. **Foreign Annulments**: If a marriage was annulled by a foreign court, any party to the marriage may apply to the Registrar to register the decree. The Registrar will register the decree in Kenya if it is recognized as valid under Kenyan law, provided the necessary documentation (such as a certified translation and declaration) is submitted. In practice, the process requires careful adherence to the procedural and time limits set out in the Marriage Act, and the involvement of the Registrar to ensure proper registration of the decree.","[""72 - Registration of divorce under Islamic law"", ""16 - Duration of marriage"", ""73 - Grounds for annulment of marriage"", ""75 - Effect of a decree of annulment"", ""60 - Copies of decrees of annulment and divorce to be sent to Registrar"", ""74 - Party to petition for annulment of marriage""]","[""Where a Kadhi, sheikh, imam or person authorised by the Registrar grants a decree for the dissolution of a marriage celebrated under Part VII, the Kadhi, sheikh, imam, Mukhi or authorised person shall deliver a copy of the decree to the Registrar.

How is institution of proceedings handled under the law? in practice,Criminal Procedure Code,89,"Under Kenyan law, the institution of proceedings is handled with a focus on accessibility and the protection of rights, as outlined in the Constitution of Kenya and other relevant legal provisions. Here's a summary of how it is handled: 1. **Right to Institute Proceedings**: Every person has the right to initiate court proceedings if they believe that the Constitution has been contravened or that a right or fundamental freedom in the Bill of Rights has been denied, violated, or infringed, or is threatened. This includes the right to act on behalf of others or in the public interest. 2. **Standing to Sue**: Individuals or associations may institute proceedings on behalf of others, groups, or in the public interest, provided they meet the criteria for standing. This allows for broader participation in legal processes. 3. **Simplified Formalities**: The law provides for minimal formalities in initiating proceedings. Courts are encouraged to entertain proceedings based on informal documentation where necessary. This reduces barriers to accessing justice. 4. **No Fees for Commencing Proceedings**: No fee may be charged for commencing proceedings, ensuring that legal action is not financially prohibitive for individuals or groups. 5. **Natural Justice and Procedural Technicalities**: While courts must observe the rules of natural justice, they are not unreasonably restricted by procedural technicalities. This ensures that the process remains fair and accessible. 6. **Role of the Chief Justice**: The Chief Justice is responsible for making rules that facilitate the institution of proceedings, ensuring that the rights of standing are fully facilitated and that the process remains accessible and fair. 7. **Complaint and Charge**: In criminal matters, proceedings may be initiated by a complaint made to a magistrate or by the presentation of an accused person who has been arrested without a warrant. The magistrate must then draw up a formal charge unless it is signed and presented by a police officer. 8. **Special Cases**: In cases involving the Council, proceedings against the Council are treated as proceedings against the national government, and must comply with the Government Proceedings Act and the Public Authorities Limitations Act. In practice, these provisions aim to ensure that individuals and groups have meaningful access to the courts, with procedural barriers minimized and the rights of all parties protected.","[""71 - Placement of children in a charitable children’s institution"", ""51 - Proceedings against the Council"", ""239 - Methods of dealing with children in conflict with the law"", ""85 - Removal to health institution"", ""6 - Legal Proceedings"", ""134 - Power of Court to make orders in certain proceedings""]","[""(1) A Charitable Children’s Institution may admit a child to its care only if— (a) in an emergency situation, the child is referred to the institution by way of an interim care order or a care order; or (b) the child is taken to the institution by an authorised officer or any person who has reasonable cause to believe that the child is in need of care and protection.

How is charge of tax handled under the law? in practice,Income Tax Act,3,"The handling of tax charges under Kenyan law, as outlined in the provided context, involves several key legal provisions: 1. **Liability of Employers and Principals**: Under the Tax Procedures Act, if an employee or agent commits an offence under a tax law, their employer or principal is treated as having also committed the offence. Similarly, if a company commits an offence, the individual who was in a senior position (e.g., chief executive officer, managing director, director, etc.) at the time of the offence is deemed to have committed the offence. 2. **Administrative Penalties and Offences**: A person cannot be subjected to both a penalty and prosecution for the same act or omission related to a tax law. The Commissioner has discretion to decide whether to impose a penalty or prosecute an offence. If a penalty has been paid and a prosecution is later initiated, the penalty is refunded, and the person is not required to pay a penalty unless the prosecution is withdrawn. 3. **Jurisdiction for Prosecution**: Under the Tax Procedures Act, a person charged with a tax offence may be prosecuted in any place in Kenya where they are in custody, and the offence is treated as having been committed in that place. Additionally, tax offences may be tried in courts designated to handle corruption or economic crimes. 4. **Aiding or Abetting an Offence**: A person who aids, abets, assists, incites, or induces another person to commit a tax offence is liable for the same sanction as the principal offender. In practice, these provisions ensure that tax offences are not only penalized but also held accountable at both the individual and organizational levels. The law emphasizes the responsibility of employers, principals, and senior officers in companies, as well as the principle of non-duplication of penalties. The jurisdictional flexibility and the possibility of trying tax offences in specialized courts also support effective enforcement.","[""34 - Priority of tax"", ""3 - Charge of tax"", ""32 - Tax as a debt due to the State"", ""5 - Charge to tax"", ""80 - General provisions relating to administrative penalties and offences"", ""40 - Security on property for unpaid tax""]","[""(1) The following amounts shall be held in trust for the Government by the person receiving or withholding the amount— (a) the value added tax payable on taxable supplies made by the person (net of any deduction for input tax allowed) when the person is a registered person under the Value Added Tax Act (Cap. 476); (b) the excise duty payable on the removal of excisable goods from the person's factory or the supply of excisable services by the person when the person is a licensed person under the Excise Duty Act (Cap. 472); (c) withholding tax; and (d) an amount that a payer is required to pay under a notice issued under section 41(2).

In practice, the process involves submitting a formal application for refund, followed by an assessment by the Commissioner. If the overpayment is confirmed, it is applied to offset existing liabilities first, with any remaining amount refunded to the taxpayer.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to tenant’s remedies? at registration,Distress for Rent Act,10,"Based on the provided context, the following safeguards exist to protect rights relating to tenants' remedies: 1. **Notice Before Forfeiture**: Under the Land Act, a lessor cannot exercise the right of forfeiture for breach of lease terms unless they have first served the lessee with a notice of at least 30 days. This notice must specify the breach, require the lessee to remedy it, and, if the breach is not related to non-payment of rent, require compensation. This provides the lessee with an opportunity to address the breach before forfeiture is enforced. 2. **Protection Against Unlawful Distress**: The Distress for Rent Act provides that distress for rent is not unlawful merely because of irregularities or unlawful acts committed afterward. If a distress is levied for a just debt, the party aggrieved by an unlawful act or irregularity may recover full satisfaction for the special damage caused. This ensures that tenants are not unfairly penalized for errors made during the distress process. 3. **Declaration of Ownership by Under-Tenant or Lodger**: If a superior landlord levies distress on goods belonging to an under-tenant, lodger, or other person, the under-tenant or lodger may serve a declaration stating that the goods are their property and not subject to the distress. This protects the rights of under-tenants and lodgers by allowing them to assert ownership of their belongings. These safeguards ensure that tenants and under-tenants have legal recourse and protection against wrongful enforcement actions.","[""62 - Discrimination contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution"", ""49 - Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya"", ""68 - Merger of lessor’s interest not to affect remedies"", ""37 - Offences relating to registration"", ""69 - Burden and benefit of covenants to run with the reversion"", ""13 - Lessee pre-emptive rights to allocation""]","[""relating to health; (d) educational or other training services, generally accessible to the public; (e) employment or indentured learner-ship; (f) the rights guaranteed under Article 53 of the Constitution; (g) the rights guaranteed under Article 55 of the Constitution; (h) the rights of older persons guaranteed under Article 57 of the Constitution; (i) the right to obtain, possess and utilize documents of registration or identification, including a certificate of birth, national identity card and passport; (j) the right to respect for personal dignity as guaranteed under article 28 of the constitution; and (k) reasonable accommodation.

What are the procedures for dealing with strike procedures? for a claimant,Labour Relations Act,76,"The procedures for dealing with strike procedures for a claimant are governed by the **Labour Relations Act** and are distinct from the procedures in the **Small Claims Court Act**, which applies to civil claims. Here is a summary of the relevant procedures under the Labour Relations Act: 1. **Prohibited Strikes or Lock-outs**: - Under ** 1(1)** of the Labour Relations Act, a strike or lock-out is prohibited if it violates any of the conditions listed in subs (a) through (h). These include situations where a strike is prohibited by law, court award, or collective agreement, or where the dispute is already referred to the Employment and Labour Relations Court or arbitration. 2. **Application to the Employment and Labour Relations Court**: - If a strike or lock-out is in violation of the Act, ** 3(1)** allows a party to apply to the Employment and Labour Relations Court to prohibit the strike or lock-out as a matter of urgency. This can be done if the strike or lock-out is prohibited under the Act or if the party that issued the notice failed to participate in conciliation in good faith. - If a party fails to attend a conciliation meeting, it may not seek relief under ** 3(1)(b)**. - The Court may also direct the parties to engage in further conciliation in good faith. 3. **Sympathetic Strikes or Lock-outs**: - A **sympathetic strike or lock-out** is also prohibited under ** 1(1)(h)**, and any such action may be subject to legal consequences under the Act. 4. **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: - Employees who participate in a strike not in compliance with the Act may be subject to **disciplinary action** and may not be entitled to **payment or benefits** under the Employment Act during the strike period. - Employees who refuse to participate in a non-compliant strike may not be **expelled from a trade union** or **disadvantaged** compared to other members. In summary, the procedures for dealing with strike procedures for a claimant involve ensuring compliance with the Labour Relations Act, applying to the Employment and Labour Relations Court for relief if necessary, and avoiding actions that constitute prohibited strikes or lock-outs.","[""79 - Strike or lock-out in compliance with this Act"", ""33 - Application of Tax Procedures Act"", ""27 - Default judgment"", ""78 - Prohibited strikes or lock-outs"", ""76 - Protected strikes and lock-outs"", ""80 - Strike or lock-out not in compliance with this Act""]","[""(1) In this Part, a \""protected strike\"" means a strike that complies with the provisions of this Part and \""protected lock-out\"" means a lock-out that complies with the provisions of this Part.

What happens when lockout procedures arises? for a public authority,Labour Relations Act,78,"When a lockout arises involving a public authority, the following legal considerations apply under Kenyan law: 1. **Protected Lockout**: A lockout is protected if it complies with the provisions of the Labour Relations Act. This includes ensuring that the lockout is in furtherance of a trade dispute and that the subject matter of the dispute is not regulated by a collective agreement or recognition agreement that prohibits the lockout. 2. **Notice Requirement**: Seven days written notice of the lockout must be given to the other parties and to the Cabinet Secretary by the authorised representative of the employer or group of employers. This applies to a lockout involving a public authority. 3. **Conciliation**: The lockout must be preceded by conciliation efforts. If the dispute is unresolved after conciliation under the Labour Relations Act or as specified in a registered collective agreement, the lockout is protected. 4. **Prohibited Lockouts**: A lockout is prohibited if it is not in furtherance of a trade dispute, if it constitutes a sympathetic lockout, or if the dispute was not referred for conciliation. Additionally, if the employer and employees are engaged in an essential service, the lockout is prohibited. 5. **Legal Consequences**: An employer (including a public authority) may not dismiss or take disciplinary action against an employee for participating in a protected lockout. Civil proceedings cannot be instituted against any person for participating in a protected lockout. 6. **Employer Obligations**: An employer is not obliged to remunerate an employee for services that the employee does not render during a protected lockout. In summary, a lockout involving a public authority is protected if it complies with the provisions of the Labour Relations Act, including the notice requirements, conciliation efforts, and the nature of the dispute.

How does one apply for relief concerning jurisdiction of the court? during investigations,Small Claims Court Act,12,"The process of applying for relief concerning the jurisdiction of the court during investigations is not directly outlined in the provided context. However, based on the relevant legal provisions, here is a general explanation: If there is a question about the jurisdiction of the court during investigations, the party involved may raise this issue at the earliest opportunity. Under **Criminal Procedure Code,  4(1)**, if it appears that the cause of complaint arose outside the jurisdiction of the court, the court may direct the case to be transferred to the court having jurisdiction where the cause of complaint arose. If the jurisdiction of the court is challenged during investigations, the party may apply for relief by showing that the court lacks jurisdiction. This could involve filing a motion or application for transfer of the case to the appropriate court.

This is usually done when a party believes that the damages awarded are not in line with the facts of the case or the law. 2. **Facts Affecting Quantum of Damages**: Under the **Evidence Act**, any fact that affects the amount of damages (i.e., the quantum of damages) is relevant. This means that during the assessment of damages, the court will consider all relevant facts that may influence the amount of compensation. 3. **Court's Discretion**: The court has discretion in determining the quantum of damages and may adjust the amount based on the evidence and applicable law. 4. **Procedure**: To apply for relief concerning the assessment of damages, the party seeking relief must file a motion or application with the court, supported by evidence and legal arguments. The court will then review the matter and decide whether to grant relief.

How is privacy handled under the law? in practice,Constitution of Kenya,31,"Privacy is handled under Kenyan law through a combination of constitutional protections, specific legislation, and principles that safeguard individuals' personal data and private affairs. Here's how privacy is addressed in practice: 1. **Constitutional Protection**: Under the Constitution of Kenya, every person has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have their personal information unnecessarily required or revealed. This right protects individuals from unwarranted intrusion into their private lives, family matters, or communications. 2. **Data Protection Act (Cap. 411C)**: The Data Protection Act is a key legal instrument that regulates the processing of personal data. It ensures that personal data is handled lawfully, transparently, and with the consent of the data subject. The Act also provides data subjects with rights such as access, rectification, erasure, and objection to processing. - **Health Data**: Personal data relating to health is strictly regulated. It may only be processed by healthcare providers or persons under professional secrecy obligations. Processing for public health reasons is allowed if it serves a public interest. - **Children's Data**: The Act also safeguards children's privacy, requiring that personal data concerning children be processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act and that parents or legal guardians have reasonable supervision over their children's data. - **Restrictions on Processing**: Processing of personal data is restricted unless it is done with the data subject's consent, for legal claims, to protect others' rights, or for public interest. Data controllers must inform data subjects before withdrawing restrictions. 3. **Children Act**: The Children Act reinforces privacy by ensuring that children are not subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy or private affairs. Parents or legal guardians have the right to supervise their children's conduct and data. 4. **Practical Application**: In practice, privacy is enforced through legal mechanisms such as data protection officers, oversight bodies, and legal redress for violations. Data controllers and processors are required to implement mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act, including conducting data protection impact assessments and maintaining transparency in data processing activities. Individuals also have the right to challenge unlawful processing of their data and seek remedies under Kenyan law. In summary, privacy in Kenya is protected through constitutional guarantees, the Data Protection Act, and the Children Act, which together ensure that personal data is handled responsibly and that individuals have rights and remedies to protect their privacy.","[""31 - Privacy"", ""26 - Detention of children in conflict with the law"", ""27 - Privacy"", ""37 - Commercial use of data"", ""8 - Functions of the Office"", ""3 - Trial of offences under Penal Code (Cap. 63) and under other laws""]","[""Every person has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have— (a) their person, home or property searched; (b) their possessions seized; (c) information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed; or (d) the privacy of their communications infringed."", ""of liberty or accommodated in child protection units shall be accommodated in facilities that adequately meet their personal needs, taking into account the condition and nature of the disability.

What are the procedures for dealing with economic and social rights? for a claimant,Constitution of Kenya,43,"The procedures for dealing with economic and social rights for a claimant are governed by the Constitution of Kenya, specifically  43 and  44, which outline the enforcement and application of the Bill of Rights. While the exact procedures are not explicitly detailed in the provided context, the following can be inferred: 1. **Right to Institute Proceedings**: Under  44(1) of the Constitution, every person has the right to institute court proceedings to claim that a right or fundamental freedom in the Bill of Rights has been denied, violated, or infringed. This includes economic and social rights. 2. **Standing to Sue**:  44(2) allows for a wide range of persons to institute proceedings, including those acting on behalf of others, in the interest of a group, or in the public interest. This means that a claimant with an economic or social rights issue may have standing to bring a claim, even if they are not the sole affected party. 3. **Procedure and Formalities**:  44(3) states that the Chief Justice shall make rules to facilitate court proceedings, including ensuring that the procedures are kept to a minimum and that the court may entertain proceedings on the basis of informal documentation. This suggests that the process is designed to be accessible and not overly burdensome. 4. **No Fees for Commencing Proceedings**:  44(3)(c) specifies that no fee may be charged for commencing proceedings. This ensures that claimants are not deterred by financial barriers when seeking redress for economic and social rights violations. 5. **Interpretation in Favor of Rights**:  43(3) and (4) require courts to interpret the Bill of Rights in a way that promotes the values of an open and democratic society and to adopt the interpretation that most favours the enforcement of rights. This means that courts are expected to take a broad and protective approach when interpreting economic and social rights. 6. **Resources and Implementation**: If the State claims it lacks resources to implement a right,  43(5) requires the court to prioritize the widest possible enjoyment of the right, considering prevailing circumstances. This implies that courts may take into account the feasibility of resource allocation when addressing claims related to economic and social rights. In summary, while the specific procedures are not fully detailed in the provided context, the legal framework supports a process that is accessible, non-discriminatory, and focused on the protection and enforcement of economic and social rights.

How is charges and mortgages handled under the law? in practice,Land Act,79,"Under Kenyan law, as outlined in the Land Act (Act No. 28 of 2016), charges and mortgages are handled as follows: 1. **Application of the Act to Charges**: Part of the Land Act applies to all charges on land, including mortgages. However, the provisions of the Act do not affect the validity of any charge or mortgage that was valid before the Act came into effect. These existing charges remain valid in accordance with their terms, even if they conflict with the Act. 2. **Equity of Redemption**: The law prohibits any rule of law—written or unwritten—that allows a chargee to foreclose on the equity of redemption in charged land. This means that a chargee cannot take possession of the charged land or receive its rents and profits solely because of a default in payment, unless the Act provides for such action. 3. **Application of Proceeds of Sale**: If a chargee exercises the power of sale, the proceeds from the sale must be applied in a specific order of priority: - First, to pay any outstanding rates, taxes, or other charges on the land. - Second, to discharge any prior charges or encumbrances. - Third, to cover costs and expenses of the sale. - Fourth, to settle the outstanding amount under the charge, including interest and other sums due. - Fifth, to satisfy any subsequent charges in order of their priority. Any remaining funds are paid to the person entitled to discharge the charge. 4. **Discharge of Charges**: A chargor or any other person entitled to discharge the charge may do so at any time before the sale of the charged land. This can be done by paying the chargee the amount secured by the charge. Upon payment, the chargee must provide a discharge of the charge in the prescribed form. 5. **Priority of Charges**: Charges are ranked according to the order in which they were registered, unless otherwise stated in the charge instrument. Informal charges rank according to the order in which they were made, with registered informal charges taking priority over unregistered ones. If two charges are made or registered on the same day, the one first in time has priority. In cases of dishonesty or fraud by the chargor or a prior chargee, the prior chargee's right to repayment may be postponed in favor of the subsequent chargee.

Re-examination is directed to clarify or explain matters raised during the cross-examination. 4. **Recall of Witness**: The court may permit a witness to be recalled for further examination-in-chief or cross-examination.

This applies to public authorities as well, ensuring that any contract involving land must meet these formalities. 4. **Employment Act**: For contracts of service made abroad, the Employment Act provides that such contracts must be attested by a judge or magistrate and authenticated by the official seal of the court to which the judge or magistrate is attached. This ensures that any contract involving a public authority is properly documented and recognized under Kenyan law.

What documents are needed to address agreements void for uncertainty? at the application stage,Law of Contract Act,6,"To address agreements void for uncertainty at the application stage, the following documents may be required: 1. **Written Instrument**: The agreement or disposition must be in writing, as many agreements, especially those involving property or legal rights, are required to be in writing under the Law of Contract Act. This ensures clarity and enforceability. 2. **Evidence of Oral Agreement**: Although oral agreements may not be admissible to contradict or vary the terms of a written document (under the Evidence Act), they may still be relevant to prove facts that invalidate the document, such as fraud, illegality, or mistake. 3. **Evidence of Legal Formalities**: If the agreement is subject to formal requirements (e.g., registration, attestation, or execution by a duly authorized representative), evidence of compliance with these formalities may be necessary to establish its validity. 4. **Evidence of Intent and Terms**: To counter a claim of uncertainty, the court may require evidence that the agreement expresses a definite intention and that its terms are clear and enforceable. This may include witness testimony or documentary evidence showing the parties' understanding of the agreement. 5. **Evidence of Conditions or Restrictions**: If the agreement includes conditions or restrictions that are challenged as void (e.g., conditions that are illegal, uncertain, or against public policy), evidence of those conditions and their legal implications may be required. 6. **Tax Documents (if applicable)**: If the agreement involves tax assessments or other documents, the Tax Procedures Act may require evidence that the document is valid in substance and effect, even if there are formal defects. In summary, the specific documents needed will depend on the nature of the agreement and the legal arguments raised. However, a written instrument, evidence of legal formalities, and documentation of the parties' intentions and terms are typically essential.","[""25 - Gift or disposition void for uncertainty"", ""44 - Void Conditions"", ""98 - Evidence of oral agreement."", ""51 - Application for grant"", ""57 - Collective agreements"", ""59 - Effect of collective agreements""]","[""A gift or disposition not expressive of any definite intention shall be void for uncertainty: Provided that— (i) no gift for charitable purposes shall be void for uncertainty of the object; or (ii) no gift whereby the legatee is expressly or impliedly given a right of selection, purchase or disposition shall be void merely by reason of the uncertainty arising from that right."", ""Any condition shall be void which— (a) requires the performance of an illegal act, or is not legally enforceable; or (b) is contrary to law, morality or public policy; or (c) is uncertain, or is too vague to be enforced; or (d) offends against any law as to accumulations, remoteness or perpetuities; or (e) is impossible ab initio, or becomes impossible by the act or default of the testator, or by an act of any court; or (f) is repugnant to the gift to which it is annexed; or (g) is in total restraint of the marriage of any person other than a widow; or (h) is attached to a gift of capital to a widow, in total restraint of her marriage, without providing for any gift over on default; or (i) forbids dispute of the will, without providing for any gift over on default; or (j) restrains alienation, voluntary or involuntary, of the subject of the gift: Provided that nothing in this subparagraph shall affect or render void any discretionary trust with gift over, or any life estate made determinable on bankruptcy."", ""on which a document is silent, and which is not inconsistent with its terms, may be proved, and in considering whether or not this paragraph of this proviso applies, the court shall have regard to the degree of formality of the document; (iii) the existence of any separate oral agreement constituting a condition precedent to the attaching of any obligation under any such contract, grant or disposition of property may be proved; (iv) the existence of any distinct subsequent oral agreement to rescind or modify any such contract, grant or disposition of property may be proved, except in cases in which such contract, grant or disposition of property is by law required to be in writing, or has been registered according to the law in force for the time being as to the registration of such documents; (v) any usage or custom by which incidents not expressly mentioned in any contract are usually annexed to contracts of that description may be proved, if the annexing of such incident would not be repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the express terms of the contract; (vi) any fact may be proved which shows in what manner the language of a document is related to existing facts."", ""(1) Every application for a grant of representation shall be made in such form as may be prescribed, signed by the applicant and witnessed in the prescribed manner.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to dependants? at registration,Law of Succession Act,29,"The safeguards that exist to protect rights relating to dependants at registration are outlined in the **Children Act** and the **Constitution of Kenya**. Specifically: - ** 5(1)(d)** of the **Children Act** states that both parents have equal responsibility for the child, including the duty to ensure that, during the temporary absence of the parent or guardian, the child shall be committed to the care of a fit person.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to divorce in civil marriages? at registration,Marriage Act,66,"The safeguards that exist to protect rights relating to divorce in civil marriages are not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, based on the Constitution of Kenya and the Marriage Act, we can infer the following: 1. **Equality and Rights During Marriage**: Under the Constitution of Kenya, parties to a marriage are entitled to equal rights during the marriage. This implies that both parties have equal standing in matters such as divorce. 2. **Legal Recognition of Marriages**: The Marriage Act states that all marriages registered under this Act have the same legal status. This suggests that civil marriages are afforded equal legal protection, including in matters of divorce. 3. **Protection of Fundamental Rights**: The Constitution guarantees fundamental rights, including the right to marry and the right to equal treatment. These rights may indirectly protect individuals in divorce proceedings by ensuring that they are not discriminated against. 4. **Limitations on Rights**: The Constitution allows for limitations on rights in specific cases, such as for members of the Kenya Defence Forces or the National Police Service. However, this does not directly apply to civil marriages in general.

How is maintenance orders handled under the law? in practice,Marriage Act,70,"Maintenance orders under the Children Act are handled as follows in practice: 1. **Financial Provision for Child**: The Court may order the person against whom a maintenance order is made to make financial provision for the child through periodic payments or lump sum payments, as the Court deems fit. 2. **Maintenance During Matrimonial Proceedings**: The Court may make a maintenance order even if matrimonial proceedings (such as divorce or judicial separation) are ongoing or have already concluded. Once maintenance proceedings have commenced, no further proceedings under any other Act may be filed without the Court's leave. 3. **Payment to a Third Party**: If the person in whose favor the maintenance order is made is not fit to receive the payments, has left the jurisdiction, is incapacitated, or has mismanaged the funds, the Court may appoint another person or institution to receive and administer the maintenance monies. The Court may also direct that the sums be secured in trust for the child. 4. **Enforcement of Maintenance Orders**: Any person, including the child, may apply to the Court for enforcement of a maintenance order if the respondent has failed to comply with the order or defaulted on payments. The Court may summon or arrest the respondent on a warrant. The Court may also require enquiries into the respondent’s means, including income, assets, and liabilities, to determine compliance. 5. **Interim Maintenance Orders**: The Court may issue an interim maintenance order on an ex-parte application if it is in the child’s best interests. The interim order remains in force pending the hearing of the inter-party application.

Who is entitled to relief concerning right to parental care? for an employer,Children Act,6,"The question appears to conflate two distinct legal concepts: **parental care** and **relief for insurance policies**. Based on the context provided, there is **no direct legal provision** that addresses **""relief concerning right to parental care""** for an employer. However, if the question is interpreted as asking about **parental responsibility** and **care of a child**, the relevant legal framework is provided in ** 4 of the Children Act**, which states: > ""(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the parents of a child shall have parental responsibility over the child on an equal basis, and neither the father nor the mother of the child shall have a superior right or claim against the other in exercise of such parental responsibility whether or not the child is born within or outside wedlock."" This means that **both parents** (or individuals with parental responsibility) have **equal rights** to the **care and upbringing** of the child, and neither parent can claim a superior right over the other. If the question is about **insurance relief** (e.g., for a child under an education or health policy), then ** 5 of the Income Tax Act** provides that: > ""(2) In this  'child', means any child of the resident individual and includes a step-child, an adopted child and an illegitimate child who was under the age of eighteen years on the date the premium was paid."" This means that **children** (including adopted children) are **included** in the definition of ""child"" for the purposes of **insurance relief**, but this does not directly address **parental care** or **employment-related rights**. ### Conclusion: There is **no provision** in the provided context that directly addresses **""relief concerning right to parental care""** for an employer.

How is pleas handled under the law? in practice,Criminal Procedure Code,137,"Under Kenyan law, as outlined in the Criminal Procedure Code (Act No. 13 of 1967, 1st Sch.), pleas are handled as follows: 1. **Plea of Autrefois Acquit or Autrefois Convict**: An accused person may plead that they have been previously convicted or acquitted of the same offence, or that they have obtained the President’s pardon for their offence. If such a plea is made and denied to be true, the court shall determine whether the plea is true or not. If the court finds the plea to be false or not supported by the facts, the accused is required to plead to the information. 2. **Plea of Guilty or Not Guilty**: The accused is required to plead not guilty, guilty, or guilty subject to a plea agreement. If the accused admits the truth of the charge (other than through a plea agreement), the court shall convict them and pass sentence unless there is sufficient cause to the contrary. If the accused does not admit the charge, the court proceeds to hear the case. If the accused refuses to plead, the court shall enter a plea of ""not guilty"" for them. 3. **Plea Agreement**: If the accused pleads guilty subject to a plea agreement, they are waiving their right to a full trial. The court must inform the accused of the nature of the charge, the maximum and minimum penalties, and the consequences of entering into a plea agreement, including the waiver of the right to appeal except in relation to the legality or extent of the sentence. 4. **Plea of Not Guilty**: If the accused pleads not guilty, the court proceeds to hear the case, and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The accused also has the right to remain silent and not to testify during the proceedings. In practice, the court ensures that the accused is fully informed of their rights and the implications of their plea, particularly in the case of a plea agreement. The court also has the authority to determine the truth of any plea of autrefois acquit or convict, and if the plea is found to be false, the accused is required to proceed with the trial.","[""3 - Trial of offences under Penal Code (Cap. 63) and under other laws"", ""279 - Plea of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict"", ""239 - Methods of dealing with children in conflict with the law"", ""36 - Primary neoplasm of theepithelial lining of the urinary bladder (Papilloma of the bladder), or of the epithelial lining of the pelvis or of the epithelial lining of the ureter"", ""72 - Registration of divorce under Islamic law"", ""41 - Statements as to law contained in books.""]","[""(1) All offences under the Penal Code (Cap. 63) shall be inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to this Code.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to interest on late payment? at registration,Tax Procedures Act,77,"Based on the provided context, the following safeguards exist to protect rights relating to interest on late payment: 1. **Limitation on Aggregate Interest**: The accrued late payment interest shall not, in aggregate, exceed the principal tax liability. This ensures that interest does not accumulate beyond the principal amount, protecting taxpayers from excessive financial burden. 2. **Order of Payment**: When a taxpayer makes a payment that is less than the total amount of tax, penalty, and interest due, the amount paid is applied first to the tax liability, then to the penalty, and finally to the late payment interest. This ensures that the principal debt is prioritized over interest. 3. **Waiver of Interest**: The respective governments may waive the whole or part of any late payment of interest if the debtor provides a good and sufficient reason for the late payment. This provides a safeguard for taxpayers who have valid reasons for delayed payments. 4. **Notice Requirement**: If interest becomes payable, the national or county government must serve a notice on the debtor demanding payment of the interest in addition to other money then due. This ensures transparency and provides the debtor with an opportunity to respond. 5. **Non-Abatement of Interest**: The amount of any tax or late payment interest due and payable under a tax law shall not be abated by the prosecution of a taxpayer for an offence under a tax law. This ensures that interest remains enforceable regardless of criminal proceedings. These safeguards collectively protect the rights of taxpayers by ensuring that interest is not excessive, is applied in a fair order of priority, and can be waived or adjusted under certain conditions.","[""38 - Late payment interest"", ""29 - Unpaid rents and other payments"", ""35 - Order of payment"", ""84 - Tax shortfall penalty"", ""49 - Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya"", ""108 - Tax to be paid despite prosecution""]","[""(1) Subject to subsection (2), a person who fails to pay a tax on or before the due date for the payment of the tax shall be liable for late payment interest at a rate equal to one per cent per month or part of a month on the amount unpaid for the period commencing on the date the tax was due and ending on the date the tax is paid.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to filing returns? at registration,Value Added Tax Act,28,"The safeguards that exist to protect rights relating to filing returns and registration are as follows: 1. **Freedom of Association**: Under the Constitution of Kenya, every person has the right to freedom of association, which includes the right to form, join, or participate in the activities of an association. This right is protected, and no person shall be compelled to join an association. While this is not directly about filing returns, it indirectly supports the right of individuals and entities to engage in legal compliance without undue coercion. 2. **Reasonable Registration and Fair Hearing**: The Constitution also provides that any legislation requiring the registration of an association must ensure that registration may not be withheld or withdrawn unreasonably. Furthermore, there must be a right to have a fair hearing before registration is cancelled. This principle can be extended to the registration process for entities required to file returns, ensuring that the process is fair and not arbitrary. 3. **Procedural Safeguards in Tax Laws**: Under the Value Added Tax Act and the Tax Procedures Act, the Cabinet Secretary may make regulations for the better carrying into effect of the provisions of these Acts. These regulations may include conditions and procedures for registration and the submission of returns. Importantly, these regulations must be tabled before the National Assembly for approval before they take effect, ensuring that they are subject to legislative oversight and public accountability. 4. **Data Protection**: The Employment Act requires that registers of children in employment be maintained in accordance with the principles of data protection as set out in the Data Protection Act. While this applies specifically to employment registers, it reflects a broader principle that data related to compliance and registration must be handled with care and respect for privacy. In summary, the safeguards include fair and transparent registration procedures, the right to a fair hearing, legislative oversight of regulations, and adherence to data protection principles. These protections ensure that individuals and entities are not unfairly burdened or restricted in their rights to register and file returns.","[""49 - Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya"", ""112 - Regulations"", ""62 - Discrimination contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution"", ""90 - Offences relating to registration or licensing"", ""67 - Regulations"", ""36 - Cancellation of registration""]","[""(1) The processing of sensitive personal data out of Kenya shall only be effected upon obtaining consent of a data subject and on obtaining confirmation of appropriate safeguards.

How is offences and penalties handled under the law? in practice,Value Added Tax Act,43,"Under Kenyan law, offences and penalties are handled as follows: 1. **Offences under the Penal Code (Cap. 63)**: All offences under the Penal Code are inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the Criminal Procedure Code. This includes the framing of charges and the procedural rules for trials. 2. **Offences under other laws**: Offences under any other law are also inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the Criminal Procedure Code, unless there is a specific enactment regulating the manner or place of inquiring into, trying, or otherwise dealing with those offences. 3. **Children Act**: Where proceedings for an offence against a child are commenced after the Children Act comes into force, the offence is dealt with in accordance with the Children Act. If the offence was committed before the Act came into force, the lesser of the penalties under the Children Act or the previous law applies. If the offence is committed after the Act comes into force, the penalties under the Children Act apply. 4. **Joinder of accused**: Offenders may be joined in one charge or information and tried together if they are accused of the same or related offences, committed in the course of the same transaction, or within a period of twelve months. 5. **Charging and framing of charges**: Charges and informations must be framed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code. The statement of the offence must be described shortly in ordinary language, and the particulars of the offence must be set out in ordinary language without unnecessary technical terms. 6. **Penalties for non-compliance**: A person subject to police supervision who fails to comply with a requirement under  344 or 344A of the Criminal Procedure Code commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months on first conviction, and up to twelve months on subsequent convictions. Reasonable efforts to comply may serve as a defence. In practice, the handling of offences and penalties is guided by the Criminal Procedure Code and other relevant statutes, with specific provisions for children, the joinder of accused, and the framing of charges. The law ensures that all offences are dealt with consistently, with due regard to procedural fairness and the rights of the accused.","[""3 - Trial of offences under Penal Code (Cap. 63) and under other laws"", ""80 - General provisions relating to administrative penalties and offences"", ""5 - Offences under other laws"", ""87 - General penalty and offences under other laws"", ""137 - Rules for the framing of charges and informations"", ""109 - Power of the Commissioner to compound offences""]","[""(1) All offences under the Penal Code (Cap. 63) shall be inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to this Code.

Additionally, if the discrimination involves employment, land, or other specific areas covered by the Employment Act, Land Act, or Persons with Disabilities Act, the relevant statutory body (such as the Employment and Labour Relations Court or the National Land Commission) may also be approached for relief.

How is freedom of expression handled under the law? in practice,Constitution of Kenya,33,"Freedom of expression in Kenya is guaranteed under  33 of the Constitution, which enshrines the right of every person to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive, or impart information or ideas, freedom of artistic creativity, and academic freedom and freedom of scientific research. This right is broad and comprehensive, but it is not absolute. The Constitution explicitly limits this right in certain circumstances. Specifically, freedom of expression does not extend to propaganda for war, incitement to violence, hate speech, or advocacy of hatred that constitutes ethnic incitement, vilification of others, or incitement to cause harm. Additionally, such advocacy must be based on grounds of discrimination specified or contemplated in  27(4) of the Constitution. In practice, the exercise of freedom of expression must also respect the rights and reputation of others, as outlined in  33(3). This means that while individuals have the right to express their views, they must do so in a manner that does not infringe on the rights of others. Furthermore, the Constitution provides that the High Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine applications for redress of a denial, violation, or infringement of rights, including freedom of expression. This ensures that individuals can seek judicial remedies if their rights are violated. The media, both electronic and print, is also protected under the Constitution. Freedom and independence of the media are guaranteed, but this does not extend to expressions that are prohibited under  33(2). The State is prohibited from exercising control over or interfering with media, and it cannot penalize individuals for opinions or views expressed in media. State-owned media must be independent, impartial, and must afford fair opportunity for the presentation of divergent views and dissenting opinions. In summary, freedom of expression in Kenya is a fundamental right that is protected by the Constitution, but it is subject to certain limitations. These limitations are clearly defined and must be justified in accordance with constitutional principles. The judiciary plays a key role in upholding and enforcing this right, ensuring that it is exercised in a manner that respects the rights of others and aligns with the values of democracy and human rights.","[""33 - Freedom of expression"", ""34 - Freedom of the media"", ""23 - Authority of courts to uphold and enforce the Bill of Rights"", ""20 - Application of Bill of Rights"", ""32 - Freedom of conscience, religion, belief and opinion"", ""29 - Freedom and security of the person""]","[""(1) Every person has the right to freedom of expression, which includes— (a) freedom to seek, receive or impart information or ideas; (b) freedom of artistic creativity; and (c) academic freedom and freedom of scientific research.

The PwD Act also mandates the Chief Justice to make rules for the exemption of persons with disabilities from paying court fees in matters related to their rights. Furthermore, the Constitution of Kenya, under  43(4), states that if the State claims it does not have the resources to implement the right to access justice, courts and other authorities must prioritize the widest possible enjoyment of the right, taking into account the vulnerability of particular groups, including persons with disabilities.

What are the procedures for dealing with conversion of casual employment? for a claimant,Employment Act,37,"The procedures for dealing with the conversion of casual employment, as outlined in the Employment Act, are as follows: 1. **Conversion of Contract**: If a casual employee works for a period or number of continuous working days equivalent to not less than one month, or performs work that cannot reasonably be completed within a period or number of working days equivalent to three months or more, their contract of service shall be deemed to be one where wages are paid monthly. This conversion is automatic under the Act. 2. **Terms and Conditions**: Once the contract is converted, the employee becomes entitled to the terms and conditions of service that would have applied if they had not initially been employed as a casual employee. This includes entitlements such as rest days, public holidays, and other benefits. 3. **Dispute Resolution**: In any dispute before the Employment and Labour Relations Court regarding the terms and conditions of service of a casual employee, the court has the power to vary the terms of service and may declare the employee to be employed on terms and conditions consistent with the Act. 4. **Complaint Mechanism**: If a casual employee is aggrieved by the treatment of their employer, they may file a complaint with the labour officer.  86 of the Employment Act applies to such complaints, which outlines the procedures for handling such claims. 5. **Claim Filing (if applicable)**: If the dispute proceeds to the Small Claims Court, the claimant must file a statement of claim in the prescribed form, signed or authenticated by the claimant or their authorized representative. The claimant may also present the claim orally to an officer of the court, who will reduce it to writing. Joint claims are admitted for determination, and any person whose name appears on the claim without their signature or mark must sign or authenticate the statement before the hearing.

This implies that the State has the authority to manage public land in accordance with these objectives. 3. **Reversion of Land**: If a lessee of public land breaches any term or condition of the grant, the land may revert to the national or county government. This serves as a remedy to ensure compliance with land use conditions. 4. **Just Compensation**: In cases where public land is acquired, just compensation is determined based on factors such as the unexpired term of the lease, the value of developments on the land, and other criteria set by the Commission.

What are the requirements for compliance with oral evidence? for a private party,Evidence Act,63,"The requirements for compliance with oral evidence for a private party in Kenya are as follows: 1. **Direct Evidence**: Oral evidence must be direct. This means that the witness must personally perceive the fact in question and testify about it. For example, if a fact can be seen, the witness must say they saw it; if it can be heard, the witness must say they heard it, and so on. 2. **Verification of Written Evidence**: If a private party wishes to present written evidence, it must be verified by a statutory declaration. This ensures that the written evidence is credible and trustworthy. 3. **Oath or Affirmation**: Although the Small Claims Court Act allows for evidence to be given without oath, the court may require that evidence be given on oath if it deems it necessary. Therefore, a private party may be required to swear an oath or make an affirmation when giving oral evidence. 4. **Accessibility of the Witness**: The witness must be able to communicate in a manner that is intelligible. If the witness is unable to speak, they may give evidence through writing or signs, provided this is done in open court. 5. **Admissibility of Admissions**: If a private party wishes to prove an oral admission regarding the contents of a document, they must first establish that they are entitled to use secondary evidence under the Evidence Act. This is necessary unless the authenticity of the document is in question. 6. **Disclosure of Evidence**: The court must disclose all evidence and information received from any party to every other party involved in the proceedings. This ensures transparency and fairness in the legal process. These requirements ensure that oral evidence is credible, relevant, and properly verified, while also respecting the rights of all parties involved in the proceedings.","[""63 - Oral evidence must be direct."", ""10 - Proof of oral wills"", ""98 - Evidence of oral agreement."", ""62 - Oral evidence."", ""22 - Oral admissions as to contents of documents."", ""163 - Evidence to impeach the credit of a witness.""]","[""an expert expressed in any treatise commonly offered for sale, and the grounds on which such opinion is held, may be proved by the production of such treatise if the author is dead or cannot be found, or has become incapable of giving evidence, or cannot be called as a witness without an amount of delay or expense which the court regards as unreasonable.

What remedies are available in relation to burden of proof? on appeal,Evidence Act,107,"In relation to the burden of proof on appeal, the following remedies are available: 1. **Burden on the Taxpayer**: Under the Tax Procedures Act, the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect.

This means that the burden of proof on factual matters is not shifted to the court; instead, the focus is on legal interpretation. 3. **Grounds for Appeal**: In an appeal by a taxpayer to the Tribunal, High Court, or Court of Appeal, the taxpayer must rely only on the grounds stated in the objection to which the decision relates. Unless the Tribunal or Court allows the addition of new grounds, the taxpayer cannot introduce new factual or legal arguments. 4. **Burden of Proof in Criminal Cases**: In criminal cases, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. However, if the court is satisfied that the evidence creates a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt, the accused may be acquitted. On appeal, the burden remains with the prosecution to justify the verdict based on the evidence. 5. **Burden of Proof in Civil Cases**: In civil cases, the burden of proof lies with the party asserting a legal right or liability. The party must prove the existence of the facts that support their claim. In summary, on appeal, the burden of proof remains with the party seeking relief (whether the taxpayer or the accused), and the court will assess whether the burden has been met based on the evidence and legal arguments presented.","[""107 - Burden of proof."", ""111 - Burden on accused in certain cases."", ""56 - General provisions relating to objections and appeals"", ""109 - Proof of particular fact."", ""62 - Burden of proof"", ""110 - Proof of admissibility.""]","[""(1) Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.

How is number of witnesses handled under the law? in practice,Evidence Act,143,"Under Kenyan law, the number of witnesses required to prove a fact is not specified in the absence of any specific legal provision. This means that the law does not impose a minimum or maximum number of witnesses that must be called to establish a fact in court. The court has discretion in determining the sufficiency of evidence based on the nature of the case and the evidence presented. In practice, the number of witnesses called depends on the complexity of the case, the nature of the evidence, and the burden of proof required. For example, in criminal cases, the prosecution must establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, which may require multiple witnesses to corroborate the facts. In contrast, in civil cases, the standard of proof is lower (on the balance of probabilities), and the number of witnesses may be fewer. Additionally, the court may adjourn the trial or take other steps to ensure the attendance of witnesses if they are not present, as outlined in the Criminal Procedure Code. The court may also consider the relevance and materiality of the testimony of each witness in determining whether the number of witnesses is sufficient to support the case.","[""143 - Number of witnesses."", ""211 - Defence"", ""308 - Additional witnesses for the defence"", ""3 - Trial of offences under Penal Code (Cap. 63) and under other laws"", ""23 - PREVIOUS CONVICTION"", ""366 - Number of judges in revision""]","[""No particular number of witnesses shall, in the absence of any provision of law to the contrary, be required for the proof of any fact."", ""If the accused person states that he has witnesses to call but that they are not present in court, and the court is satisfied that the absence of those witnesses is not due to any fault or neglect of the accused person, and that there is a likelihood that they could, if present, give material evidence on behalf of the accused person, the court may adjourn the trial and issue process, or take other steps, to compel the attendance of the witnesses.
