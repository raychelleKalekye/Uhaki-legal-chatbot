This ensures that the employee is not coerced or misled into signing the contract. 2. **Absence of Fraud, Coercion, or Undue Influence**: The labour officer must also be satisfied that there is no fraud, coercion, or undue influence in the making of the contract. This protects the employee from being forced into an unfair or exploitative agreement. 3. **Compliance with Legal Requirements**: The contract must be in the prescribed form and comply with the provisions of the Employment Act. This ensures that the contract adheres to the minimum legal standards for employment. 4. **Medical Fitness**: The labour officer must be satisfied that the employee is medically fit for the performance of their duties under the contract. This protects the employee's health and safety rights. 5. **No Conflicting Employment**: The labour officer must also be satisfied that the employee is not bound to serve under any other contract of service during the period provided in the foreign contract.

What happens when termination notice arises? for a public authority,Employment Act,35,"When a termination notice arises for an employee of a public authority, the provisions of the Employment Act apply, subject to any specific rules or exceptions that may apply to public sector employment. Under ** 4 of the Employment Act** (Termination notice), an employee who receives a notice of termination is entitled to service pay for every year worked, the terms of which shall be fixed. This applies unless the employee is a member of a scheme that provides more favourable terms, such as a registered pension or provident fund scheme, a gratuity or service pay scheme established under a collective agreement, or any other scheme operated by the employer that is more favourable than those provided under the Employment Act. Additionally, ** 46** of the Employment Act allows an employee whose services have been terminated to dispute the lawfulness or fairness of the termination.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to allocation of land? at registration,Land Act,24,"The safeguards that exist to protect rights relating to the allocation of land at registration include the following: 1. **Registration of Rights**: Under the Land Act, rights and interests in public land must be recorded in the **register of public land**, which is maintained under the law relating to land registration. This ensures transparency and legal recognition of land rights. 2. **Restrictive Agreements**: The Act allows for the imposition of **restrictive agreements**, such as **restrictive covenants**, which may limit the use or enjoyment of land for the benefit of the owner or neighboring land. These agreements are binding and enforceable upon registration. 3. **Public Notice and Transparency**: The allocation of public land is subject to **public notice**, such as through tenders, public auctions, or other prescribed methods. This ensures that the process is open and that all interested parties are informed. 4. **Non-Transferability of Land Without Development**: Public land allocated under the Act **cannot be sold, disposed of, subleased, or subdivided** unless it is developed for the purpose for which it was allocated. This safeguard ensures that land is used in accordance with its intended purpose. 5. **Reversion of Land**: If land allocated under the Act is not developed in accordance with the terms and conditions, it **automatically reverts back to the national or county government**. This ensures that land is not held in a way that undermines its public purpose. 6. **Equal Recognition of Land Rights**: The Act guarantees **equal recognition and enforcement of land rights** arising under all tenure systems, ensuring that no discrimination exists in the ownership or access to land.

How is compulsory acquisition handled under the law? in practice,Land Act,75,"Compulsory acquisition under Kenyan law is handled through a structured process outlined in the **Land Act** and other relevant legal frameworks. Here is a summary of how it is managed: 1. **Notice of Intention to Acquire**: The Commission must first publish a notice of intention to acquire the land. This notice must be published in a manner that ensures it reaches all interested parties. The notice must specify the date on which possession of the land and title will vest in the national or county government. 2. **Formal Taking of Possession**: After the award has been made, the Commission may take formal possession of the land by serving a notice on all interested parties. This notice must state that possession and title will vest in the national or county government. The taking of possession must not result in persons being rendered homeless. 3. **Urgent Necessity**: In cases of urgent necessity where delay would be contrary to public interest, the Commission may take possession of the land after fifteen days from the date of publication of the notice of intention to acquire. This process bypasses some of the normal procedures but still requires compliance with the prescribed timeline. 4. **Compensation**: The Commission is required to pay compensation to the landowners. The form of compensation can be elected by the landowner. However, compensation is not payable to a public body unless there is a demonstrable inference that the land was purchased and developed by that public body. 5. **Effect on Plant and Machinery**: If plant or machinery is attached to the land, the interested party may serve a notice to the Commission requesting the removal of such assets before the acquisition process begins. This notice must be given after the notice of intention to acquire the land has been published and not later than fifteen days before the inquiry under  112(1). 6. **Public Purpose**: Land may be compulsorily acquired if the Commission certifies that it is required for public purposes or in the public interest, as necessary for the stated public purpose. 7. **Tribunal and Appeals**: Matters relating to compulsory acquisition are referred to the Tribunal, which has the power to confirm, vary, or quash the Commission's decision. A party dissatisfied with the Tribunal's decision may appeal to the court on grounds such as the decision being contrary to law or procedural defects. 8. **Lapse of Acquisition**: If the acquisition process is not completed within twenty-four months from the date of publication of the notice of intention to acquire the land, the acquisition shall lapse.

Who is entitled to relief concerning charges and mortgages? for an employer,Land Act,79,"The question appears to conflate two distinct legal areas: relief concerning charges and mortgages, and the rights of an employer in the context of employment law. Based on the provided context: 1. **Relief concerning charges and mortgages** is addressed in **[3] Land Act - Application for relief by chargor** and **[4] Land Act - Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs**. These provisions outline that **the chargor** (the person who created the charge or mortgage) may apply for relief against the exercise of remedies by the chargee (the lender or mortgagee). Relief may also be sought by **joint chargors**, **spouses** (in certain circumstances), or **bankruptcy trustees** if the chargor has been adjudged bankrupt. 2. **Employer-related rights** are addressed in **[2] Employment Act - Repayment of remuneration wrongfully withheld or deducted** and **[5] Employment Act - Debts to which Part applies**. These provisions relate to **employees** and their rights regarding the repayment of wages or compensation, not to relief concerning charges or mortgages. ### Conclusion: **No legal provision in the provided context directly addresses who is entitled to relief concerning charges and mortgages for an employer.** The available information does not clarify whether an employer can be a chargor or whether they are entitled to relief in the context of charges or mortgages.

Before proceeding to sell the land, the chargee must wait at least forty days from the date of service of the notice to sell. Additionally, the court may refuse to grant an order for the sale if it appears that the default has been remedied, the threat to the security has been removed, or the chargor has taken the steps required by the notice served under  90. If the default involves public land, the court will also consider the impact of the sale on the occupation of the dwelling house by the chargor and dependants, and whether the sale would impose undue disturbance on them. The court will assess whether the chargor will be rendered landless or homeless, and whether the sale is necessary for the chargee to recover the money owing under the charge. In summary, when a default arises and the charged land is public land, the chargee must follow the procedures outlined in the Land Act, including serving a notice to sell, waiting for the required period, and ensuring that the sale is approved by the court if necessary.","[""90 - Remedies of a chargee"", ""96 - Chargee’s power of sale"", ""90 - Remedies of a chargee"", ""104 - Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs"", ""95 - Withdrawal of lender from possession"", ""104 - Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs""]","[""(1) If a chargor is in default of any obligation, fails to pay interest or any other periodic payment or any part thereof due under any charge or in the performance or observation of any covenant, express or implied, in any charge, and continues to be in default for one month, the chargee may serve on the chargor a notice, in writing, to pay the money owing or to perform and observe the agreement as the case may be.

What happens when cross-examination arises? for a public authority,Evidence Act,164,"When cross-examination arises for a public authority, the following legal principles apply under Kenyan law: 1. **Cross-examination of witnesses for the prosecution**: The witnesses called for the prosecution shall be subject to cross-examination by the accused person or his advocate, and to re-examination by the advocate for the prosecution. 2. **Order and direction of examinations**: - Witnesses shall first be examined-in-chief, then, if the adverse party so desires, cross-examined, then, if the party calling them so desires, re-examined. - The court may permit a witness to be recalled for further examination-in-chief or for further cross-examination, and if it does so, the parties have the right of further cross-examination and re-examination respectively. 3. **Cross-examination as to credibility**: When a witness is cross-examined, he may be asked any questions that tend to test his accuracy, veracity, or credibility, or to discover who he is and what is his position in life, or to shake his credit by injuring his character, even if the answer may tend to incriminate him or expose him to a penalty or forfeiture. 4. **Cross-examination of the accused person**: A person charged with an offence and called as a witness for the defence may be asked any question in cross-examination, even if the answer may tend to incriminate him as to the offence charged. 5. **Power to summon witnesses or examine persons present**: A court may summon or call any person as a witness, or examine any person in attendance though not summoned as a witness, and the court shall summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person if his evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the case. The prosecutor, the advocate for the prosecution, the defendant, or his advocate shall have the right to cross-examine any such person.

Who is entitled to relief concerning intermeddling with estate? for an employer,Law of Succession Act,45,"The question regarding ""relief concerning intermeddling with estate"" for an employer is not directly addressed in the provided legal context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the **dependants of a deceased employee** may be entitled to relief concerning intermeddling with the estate, particularly in the context of compensation payments under the **Work Injury Benefits Act**. Specifically, under **[3] Work Injury Benefits Act - Payment of compensation**, it is stated that on the death of an employee, the unpaid balance of any compensation awarded to the employee does not form part of the employee’s estate and shall be paid to the employee’s dependants as specified in the Third Schedule. This implies that the **dependants** may have a claim to relief concerning intermeddling with the estate, as the compensation is directed to them rather than the estate. If the question refers to an employer being involved in intermeddling with an estate, there is no direct legal provision in the context that addresses this.

What remedies are available in relation to types of marriages? on appeal,Marriage Act,6,"Based on the provided context, the remedies available in relation to types of marriages on appeal are as follows: 1. **Appeal against a decision to permit a marriage ceremony**: A marriage ceremony may not be performed until any appeal that has been made against a decision of the Registrar to permit the marriage ceremony to be performed is heard and determined. This indicates that there is a procedural remedy available to challenge the Registrar's decision to allow the marriage to proceed. 2. **Annulment of a marriage**: A party to a marriage may petition the court to annul the marriage on specific grounds, such as lack of consummation, prohibited relationships, bigamy, lack of free consent, absence of a party, pregnancy without the husband's knowledge, or insanity without the petitioner's knowledge. The court may grant annulment if the petition is made within one year of the marriage, the petitioner was ignorant of the facts, and the marriage has not been consummated since the petition was made. 3. **Dissolution of a Christian marriage**: A party to a Christian marriage may petition the court for dissolution on grounds such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, exceptional depravity, or irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. 4. **Dissolution of a customary marriage**: A party to a customary marriage may petition the court for dissolution on grounds such as adultery, cruelty, desertion, exceptional depravity, irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, or any valid ground under the customary law of the petitioner. The Cabinet Secretary may make regulations for the implementation of these grounds. 5. **Dissolution of a Hindu marriage**: Although the context does not provide specific details on Hindu marriages, it is implied that dissolution may be available under similar grounds as customary marriages, subject to applicable laws and regulations.

How is annulment handled under the law? in practice,Marriage Act,69,"Annulment under Kenyan law, as outlined in the Marriage Act, is a legal process that declares a marriage null and void from its inception, as if it never existed. Here's how annulment is handled in practice: 1. **Grounds for Annulment**: A party to a marriage may petition the court to annul the marriage on specific grounds, including: - The marriage has not been consummated. - One of the parties was in a prohibited relationship at the time of the marriage. - One of the parties was already married to another person at the time of the marriage. - The petitioner’s consent was not freely given. - One of the parties was absent at the time of the marriage. - The wife was pregnant at the time of the marriage, and the husband is not responsible for the pregnancy. - One of the parties suffers from recurrent bouts of insanity at the time of the marriage, without the petitioner's knowledge. 2. **Time Limit for Petition**: The petition for annulment must be made within one year of the celebration of the marriage. This is a strict time limit, and the court will not entertain petitions beyond this period. 3. **Effect of Annulment**: Once a decree of annulment is granted, the parties are deemed never to have been married. However, the annulment does not: - Render lawful anything done unlawfully during the marriage or render unlawful anything done lawfully. - Affect the competence of either party as a witness in respect of anything done during the marriage. - Relieve either party of any debt properly incurred on behalf of the other during the marriage. 4. **Registration of Decrees**: If a decree of annulment is granted by a Kenyan court, a certified copy of the decree must be delivered to the Registrar. The Registrar will then register the annulment in a register maintained for this purpose. 5. **Foreign Annulments**: If a marriage was annulled by a foreign court, any party to the marriage may apply to the Registrar to register the decree. The Registrar will register the decree in Kenya if it is recognized as valid under Kenyan law, provided the necessary documentation (such as a certified translation and declaration) is submitted. In practice, the process requires careful adherence to the procedural and time limits set out in the Marriage Act, and the involvement of the Registrar to ensure proper registration of the decree.","[""16 - Duration of marriage"", ""60 - Copies of decrees of annulment and divorce to be sent to Registrar"", ""75 - Effect of a decree of annulment"", ""73 - Grounds for annulment of marriage"", ""67 - Recognition of decree by foreign court in matrimonial proceedings"", ""62 - Endorsement of marriage registers""]","[""A marriage registered under this Act subsists until it is determined by— (a) the death of a spouse; (b) a decree declaring the presumption of the death of a spouse; (c) a decree of annulment; (d) a decree of divorce; or (e) a decree of divorce or annulment obtained in a foreign country and recognized in Kenya under this Act."", ""Where a court grants a decree of the annulment of a marriage or the dissolution of a marriage, it shall deliver a certified copy of the decree to the Registrar and the Registrar shall register the annulment or dissolution in a register maintained for the purpose."", ""The parties to a marriage which has been annulled by decree absolute of the court shall be deemed never to have been married but a decree of annulment shall not— (a) render lawful anything which was done unlawfully during the marriage or render unlawful anything which was done lawfully during the marriage; or (b) affect the competence of either of the parties as a witness in respect of anything done or omitted to be done, or any privilege in respect of communications between them, during the— (i) marriage; or (ii) relieve either party of any debt properly incurred on behalf of the other during the marriage."", ""(1) A party to a marriage may petition the court to annul the marriage on the ground that— (a) the marriage has not been consummated since its celebration; (b) at the time of the marriage and without the knowledge of either party, the parties were in a prohibited relationship; (c) in the case of a monogamous marriage, at the time of the marriage one of the parties was married to another person; (d) the petitioner’s consent was not freely given; (e) a party to the marriage was absent at the time of the celebration of the marriage; (f) at the time of the marriage and without the knowledge of the husband, the wife is pregnant and that the husband is not responsible for the pregnancy; or (g) at the time of the marriage and without the knowledge of the petitioner, the other party suffers recurrent bouts of insanity.

Siblings should not be separated unless there are compelling reasons, as recorded by the Court. 3. **Maintaining Contact**: A child who is separated from one or both parents has the right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with the parent(s), unless the Court determines that such contact is not in the child's best interest. 4. **Court Consideration**: In any case involving a child, the Court must consider the child's welfare and act in their best interest. This includes taking steps to remove the child from undesirable surroundings and ensuring proper care, education, and maintenance. 5. **Care Orders**: If the Court determines that a child is in need of care and protection, it may make a care order. This order may include conditions, restrictions, or directions regarding the enforcement of the order or the conduct of the child and any person named in the order. 6. **Religious and Special Needs Consideration**: The Court must, as far as reasonably practicable, entrust the child to the care of a person or institution that aligns with the child's religious faith or is equipped to meet the child's special needs, such as those of a child with a disability. These procedures ensure that the child's right to parental care is upheld and that any separation from parents is only done when necessary and in the child's best interest.","[""31 - Equal parental responsibility"", ""148 - Parent or guardian to be heard in any application"", ""31 - Equal parental responsibility"", ""11 - Right to parental care"", ""53 - Children"", ""236 - Duty to provide for the welfare of a child""]","[""(ii) determine the name of the child; (iii) procure registration of the birth of his or her child; (iv) appoint a legal guardian in respect of the child; (v) receive, recover and otherwise deal with the property of the child for the benefit, and in the best interests, of the child; (vi) facilitate or restrict the migration of the child from or within Kenya; (vii) upon the death of the child, to arrange for the burial, cremation of the child or any other acceptable method of interment; and (d) the duty to ensure that, during the temporary absence of the parent or guardian, the child shall be committed to the care of a fit person.

How is institution of proceedings handled under the law? in practice,Criminal Procedure Code,89,"Under Kenyan law, the institution of proceedings is handled with a focus on accessibility and the protection of rights, as outlined in the Constitution of Kenya and other relevant legal provisions. Here's a summary of how it is handled: 1. **Right to Institute Proceedings**: Every person has the right to initiate court proceedings if they believe that the Constitution has been contravened or that a right or fundamental freedom in the Bill of Rights has been denied, violated, or infringed, or is threatened. This includes the right to act on behalf of others or in the public interest. 2. **Standing to Sue**: Individuals or associations may institute proceedings on behalf of others, groups, or in the public interest, provided they meet the criteria for standing. This allows for broader participation in legal processes. 3. **Simplified Formalities**: The law provides for minimal formalities in initiating proceedings. Courts are encouraged to entertain proceedings based on informal documentation where necessary. This reduces barriers to accessing justice. 4. **No Fees for Commencing Proceedings**: No fee may be charged for commencing proceedings, ensuring that legal action is not financially prohibitive for individuals or groups. 5. **Natural Justice and Procedural Technicalities**: While courts must observe the rules of natural justice, they are not unreasonably restricted by procedural technicalities. This ensures that the process remains fair and accessible. 6. **Role of the Chief Justice**: The Chief Justice is responsible for making rules that facilitate the institution of proceedings, ensuring that the rights of standing are fully facilitated and that the process remains accessible and fair. 7. **Complaint and Charge**: In criminal matters, proceedings may be initiated by a complaint made to a magistrate or by the presentation of an accused person who has been arrested without a warrant. The magistrate must then draw up a formal charge unless it is signed and presented by a police officer. 8. **Special Cases**: In cases involving the Council, proceedings against the Council are treated as proceedings against the national government, and must comply with the Government Proceedings Act and the Public Authorities Limitations Act. In practice, these provisions aim to ensure that individuals and groups have meaningful access to the courts, with procedural barriers minimized and the rights of all parties protected.","[""84 - Absconding children and children of difficult character"", ""91 - Jurisdiction of the Children’s Court"", ""29 - Enforcement of rights under this Part"", ""3 - Trial of offences under Penal Code (Cap. 63) and under other laws"", ""193 - Right of accused to be defended"", ""71 - Placement of children in a charitable children’s institution""]","[""or (iii) cases where the child is suffering from a mental illness.

What are the procedures for dealing with judgment? for a claimant,Criminal Procedure Code,169,"The procedures for dealing with judgment for a claimant under the Small Claims Court Act are as follows: 1. **Default Judgment**: If the respondent fails to respond to the claim within the prescribed period, the Court may enter judgment for the claimant and order the relief sought in the statement of claim.

How is charge of tax handled under the law? in practice,Income Tax Act,3,"The handling of tax charges under Kenyan law, as outlined in the provided context, involves several key legal provisions: 1. **Liability of Employers and Principals**: Under the Tax Procedures Act, if an employee or agent commits an offence under a tax law, their employer or principal is treated as having also committed the offence. Similarly, if a company commits an offence, the individual who was in a senior position (e.g., chief executive officer, managing director, director, etc.) at the time of the offence is deemed to have committed the offence. 2. **Administrative Penalties and Offences**: A person cannot be subjected to both a penalty and prosecution for the same act or omission related to a tax law. The Commissioner has discretion to decide whether to impose a penalty or prosecute an offence. If a penalty has been paid and a prosecution is later initiated, the penalty is refunded, and the person is not required to pay a penalty unless the prosecution is withdrawn. 3. **Jurisdiction for Prosecution**: Under the Tax Procedures Act, a person charged with a tax offence may be prosecuted in any place in Kenya where they are in custody, and the offence is treated as having been committed in that place. Additionally, tax offences may be tried in courts designated to handle corruption or economic crimes. 4. **Aiding or Abetting an Offence**: A person who aids, abets, assists, incites, or induces another person to commit a tax offence is liable for the same sanction as the principal offender. In practice, these provisions ensure that tax offences are not only penalized but also held accountable at both the individual and organizational levels. The law emphasizes the responsibility of employers, principals, and senior officers in companies, as well as the principle of non-duplication of penalties. The jurisdictional flexibility and the possibility of trying tax offences in specialized courts also support effective enforcement.","[""34 - Priority of tax"", ""80 - General provisions relating to administrative penalties and offences"", ""40 - Security on property for unpaid tax"", ""32 - Tax as a debt due to the State"", ""102 - Offences by officers and staff of the Authority"", ""79 - Informal charges""]","[""(1) The following amounts shall be held in trust for the Government by the person receiving or withholding the amount— (a) the value added tax payable on taxable supplies made by the person (net of any deduction for input tax allowed) when the person is a registered person under the Value Added Tax Act (Cap. 476); (b) the excise duty payable on the removal of excisable goods from the person's factory or the supply of excisable services by the person when the person is a licensed person under the Excise Duty Act (Cap. 472); (c) withholding tax; and (d) an amount that a payer is required to pay under a notice issued under  41(2).

The surplus, if any, is handed over to the owner. 3. **Valuation of Goods**: If the tenant or owner requests a valuation of the goods and chattels distrained, the person distraining must cause them to be valued by an approved valuer. The goods may then be sold for the best price obtainable, towards satisfaction of the rent and costs. 4. **Extension of Time for Replevy**: The tenant or owner may extend the fourteen-day period for replevy to fifteen days by making a written request and providing security for any additional costs. 5. **Remedies for Unlawful Acts**: If any unlawful act or irregularity occurs during the distraint process, the distress itself is not deemed unlawful.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to tenant’s remedies? at registration,Distress for Rent Act,10,"Based on the provided context, the following safeguards exist to protect rights relating to tenants' remedies: 1. **Notice Before Forfeiture**: Under the Land Act, a lessor cannot exercise the right of forfeiture for breach of lease terms unless they have first served the lessee with a notice of at least 30 days. This notice must specify the breach, require the lessee to remedy it, and, if the breach is not related to non-payment of rent, require compensation. This provides the lessee with an opportunity to address the breach before forfeiture is enforced. 2. **Protection Against Unlawful Distress**: The Distress for Rent Act provides that distress for rent is not unlawful merely because of irregularities or unlawful acts committed afterward. If a distress is levied for a just debt, the party aggrieved by an unlawful act or irregularity may recover full satisfaction for the special damage caused. This ensures that tenants are not unfairly penalized for errors made during the distress process. 3. **Declaration of Ownership by Under-Tenant or Lodger**: If a superior landlord levies distress on goods belonging to an under-tenant, lodger, or other person, the under-tenant or lodger may serve a declaration stating that the goods are their property and not subject to the distress. This protects the rights of under-tenants and lodgers by allowing them to assert ownership of their belongings. These safeguards ensure that tenants and under-tenants have legal recourse and protection against wrongful enforcement actions.","[""69 - Burden and benefit of covenants to run with the reversion"", ""15 - Distress for rent not unlawful for any irregularity"", ""19 - Under-tenant or lodger may make declaration that goods distrained are his property"", ""60 - Lessee remaining in possession after termination of lease without the consent of lessor"", ""22 - Exclusion of certain tenants"", ""19 - Under-tenant or lodger may make declaration that goods distrained are his property""]","[""to exercise a right to which sub (1)(b) refers may exercise the right even if it first became exercisable or accrued before the time at which that person became so entitled unless before that time, the right was waived or the lessee was released from the obligation to which the right relates.

What are the procedures for dealing with strike procedures? for a claimant,Labour Relations Act,76,"The procedures for dealing with strike procedures for a claimant are governed by the **Labour Relations Act** and are distinct from the procedures in the **Small Claims Court Act**, which applies to civil claims. Here is a summary of the relevant procedures under the Labour Relations Act: 1. **Prohibited Strikes or Lock-outs**: - Under ** 1(1)** of the Labour Relations Act, a strike or lock-out is prohibited if it violates any of the conditions listed in subs (a) through (h). These include situations where a strike is prohibited by law, court award, or collective agreement, or where the dispute is already referred to the Employment and Labour Relations Court or arbitration. 2. **Application to the Employment and Labour Relations Court**: - If a strike or lock-out is in violation of the Act, ** 3(1)** allows a party to apply to the Employment and Labour Relations Court to prohibit the strike or lock-out as a matter of urgency. This can be done if the strike or lock-out is prohibited under the Act or if the party that issued the notice failed to participate in conciliation in good faith. - If a party fails to attend a conciliation meeting, it may not seek relief under ** 3(1)(b)**. - The Court may also direct the parties to engage in further conciliation in good faith. 3. **Sympathetic Strikes or Lock-outs**: - A **sympathetic strike or lock-out** is also prohibited under ** 1(1)(h)**, and any such action may be subject to legal consequences under the Act. 4. **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: - Employees who participate in a strike not in compliance with the Act may be subject to **disciplinary action** and may not be entitled to **payment or benefits** under the Employment Act during the strike period. - Employees who refuse to participate in a non-compliant strike may not be **expelled from a trade union** or **disadvantaged** compared to other members.

What happens when lockout procedures arises? for a public authority,Labour Relations Act,78,"When a lockout arises involving a public authority, the following legal considerations apply under Kenyan law: 1. **Protected Lockout**: A lockout is protected if it complies with the provisions of the Labour Relations Act. This includes ensuring that the lockout is in furtherance of a trade dispute and that the subject matter of the dispute is not regulated by a collective agreement or recognition agreement that prohibits the lockout. 2. **Notice Requirement**: Seven days written notice of the lockout must be given to the other parties and to the Cabinet Secretary by the authorised representative of the employer or group of employers. This applies to a lockout involving a public authority. 3. **Conciliation**: The lockout must be preceded by conciliation efforts. If the dispute is unresolved after conciliation under the Labour Relations Act or as specified in a registered collective agreement, the lockout is protected. 4. **Prohibited Lockouts**: A lockout is prohibited if it is not in furtherance of a trade dispute, if it constitutes a sympathetic lockout, or if the dispute was not referred for conciliation. Additionally, if the employer and employees are engaged in an essential service, the lockout is prohibited. 5. **Legal Consequences**: An employer (including a public authority) may not dismiss or take disciplinary action against an employee for participating in a protected lockout. Civil proceedings cannot be instituted against any person for participating in a protected lockout. 6. **Employer Obligations**: An employer is not obliged to remunerate an employee for services that the employee does not render during a protected lockout. In summary, a lockout involving a public authority is protected if it complies with the provisions of the Labour Relations Act, including the notice requirements, conciliation efforts, and the nature of the dispute. If the lockout is protected, the employer cannot take disciplinary action against employees involved, and civil proceedings cannot be brought against them.","[""19 - Conservation of land based natural resources"", ""394 - Expenses of assessors, witnesses, etc."", ""386 - Police to inquire and report on suicide, etc."", ""43 - Security for keeping the peace"", ""61 - Discharge of sureties"", ""43 - Security for keeping the peace""]","[""(1) The Commission shall make rules and regulations for the sustainable conservation of land based natural resources.

How does one apply for relief concerning jurisdiction of the court? during investigations,Small Claims Court Act,12,"The process of applying for relief concerning the jurisdiction of the court during investigations is not directly outlined in the provided context. However, based on the relevant legal provisions, here is a general explanation: If there is a question about the jurisdiction of the court during investigations, the party involved may raise this issue at the earliest opportunity. Under **Criminal Procedure Code,  4(1)**, if it appears that the cause of complaint arose outside the jurisdiction of the court, the court may direct the case to be transferred to the court having jurisdiction where the cause of complaint arose. If the jurisdiction of the court is challenged during investigations, the party may apply for relief by showing that the court lacks jurisdiction. This could involve filing a motion or application for transfer of the case to the appropriate court. The court will then determine whether it has jurisdiction and, if not, may transfer the case to the court with proper jurisdiction. Since the specific procedure for applying for relief concerning jurisdiction during investigations is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, it is recommended to consult the relevant legal provisions or seek legal advice for a detailed process.","[""42 - Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land"", ""155 - Unlawful occupation of land"", ""103 - Application for relief by chargor"", ""103 - Application for relief by chargor"", ""76 - Relief against forfeiture"", ""104 - Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs""]","[""(1) If the vendor, after serving on the purchaser a notice under  41, applies to the court for an order for possession of the land or if the vendor has peaceably entered on to the land in order to regain possession under  39, the purchaser may apply to the court for relief against the rescission of the contract either— (a) in the proceedings for an order for possession; or (b) in proceedings brought by the purchaser.

This prevents duplicate or conflicting proceedings. 3. **Filing of Claims**: Every claim must be filed in the prescribed form and signed or authenticated by the claimant or their authorized representative. This ensures that claims are properly documented and legally valid. 4. **Electronic Filing**: Any party may lodge their statement of claim or defence by electronic means, which supports accessibility and convenience in the filing process. 5. **Protection Against Abuse and Exploitation**: While not directly related to the filing process, the Persons with Disabilities Act provides protection against abuse, exploitation, and violence, which indirectly supports the rights of individuals with disabilities to access legal processes and file claims without fear of harm.","[""49 - Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya"", ""48 - Conditions for transfer out of Kenya"", ""51 - General exemptions"", ""45 - Permitted grounds for processing sensitive personal data"", ""31 - Data protection impact assessment"", ""25 - Principles of data protection""]","[""(1) The processing of sensitive personal data out of Kenya shall only be effected upon obtaining consent of a data subject and on obtaining confirmation of appropriate safeguards.

The Cabinet Secretary, in consultation with the relevant education authority, is responsible for developing and implementing policies to realize this right. 2. **Inclusive Education**: Every person with a disability has the right to admission to any institution of learning and access to an inclusive, quality education on an equal basis with others. No person shall be excluded from the education system on the basis of disability. The National and County Governments must ensure that persons with disabilities have access to inclusive education without discrimination. 3. **Support Services**: Every person with a disability is entitled to receive the support services required within the general education system to facilitate effective inclusive education. This includes individualized support measures, appropriate equipment, assistive devices, adaptive technologies, and other necessary accommodations. 4. **Admission and Non-Discrimination**: Learning institutions must take into account the needs of persons with disabilities regarding entry requirements, pass marks, curriculum, examinations, auxiliary services, use of school facilities, class schedules, and physical education requirements. No person with a disability shall be denied admission on the basis of disability. 5. **Legal Consequences for Discrimination**: Any person who denies a person with a disability admission on the basis of disability commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred thousand shillings or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both. The court may also order unconditional admission of the person with a disability. 6. **Policy and Financial Frameworks**: The Cabinet Secretary and County Education Committees must develop and implement policies and sustainable financial frameworks to achieve the full realization of the right to education for persons with disabilities.

What remedies are available in relation to action for wrongful act causing death? on appeal,Fatal Accidents Act,4,"Under the Fatal Accidents Act, the following remedies are available in relation to an action for a wrongful act causing death: 1. **Action for Damages**: The person who would have been liable if death had not ensued is liable to an action for damages, even though the death occurred. This action can be brought despite the fact that the death was caused under circumstances amounting to a felony. 2. **Funeral Expenses**: In addition to damages for the wrongful act, the court may award damages for funeral expenses of the deceased person, provided those expenses have been incurred by the parties for whom and for whose benefit the action is brought. 3. **Appeals**: If the case involves an appeal, the accused must be informed of the time within which they may appeal. This is governed by the Criminal Procedure Code, which ensures that the accused is aware of their right to appeal and the time limits for doing so. These remedies are available in relation to an action for a wrongful act causing death, and the appeal process is governed by the Criminal Procedure Code.","[""23 - PREVIOUS CONVICTION"", ""23 -

How does one apply for relief concerning assessment of damages? during investigations,Fatal Accidents Act,8,"The process for applying for relief concerning the assessment of damages is not directly addressed in the provided context. However, based on the relevant legal provisions, the following general principles apply: 1. **Application for Relief**: Relief concerning the assessment of damages may be sought through the court, typically by filing a formal application or motion. This is usually done when a party believes that the damages awarded are not in line with the facts of the case or the law. 2. **Facts Affecting Quantum of Damages**: Under the **Evidence Act**, any fact that affects the amount of damages (i.e., the quantum of damages) is relevant. This means that during the assessment of damages, the court will consider all relevant facts that may influence the amount of compensation. 3. **Court's Discretion**: The court has discretion in determining the quantum of damages and may adjust the amount based on the evidence and applicable law. 4. **Procedure**: To apply for relief concerning the assessment of damages, the party seeking relief must file a motion or application with the court, supported by evidence and legal arguments. The court will then review the matter and decide whether to grant relief. Since the specific procedure for applying for relief concerning the assessment of damages is not explicitly outlined in the provided context, it is recommended to consult the relevant procedural rules or seek further clarification from the court.","[""42 - Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land"", ""103 - Application for relief by chargor"", ""103 - Application for relief by chargor"", ""42 - Computation of credits under special arrangements"", ""31 - Insurance relief"", ""155 - Unlawful occupation of land""]","[""(1) If the vendor, after serving on the purchaser a notice under  41, applies to the court for an order for possession of the land or if the vendor has peaceably entered on to the land in order to regain possession under  39, the purchaser may apply to the court for relief against the rescission of the contract either— (a) in the proceedings for an order for possession; or (b) in proceedings brought by the purchaser.

How is privacy handled under the law? in practice,Constitution of Kenya,31,"Privacy is handled under Kenyan law through a combination of constitutional protections, specific legislation, and principles that safeguard individuals' personal data and private affairs. Here's how privacy is addressed in practice: 1. **Constitutional Protection**: Under the Constitution of Kenya, every person has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have their personal information unnecessarily required or revealed. This right protects individuals from unwarranted intrusion into their private lives, family matters, or communications. 2. **Data Protection Act (Cap. 411C)**: The Data Protection Act is a key legal instrument that regulates the processing of personal data. It ensures that personal data is handled lawfully, transparently, and with the consent of the data subject. The Act also provides data subjects with rights such as access, rectification, erasure, and objection to processing. - **Health Data**: Personal data relating to health is strictly regulated. It may only be processed by healthcare providers or persons under professional secrecy obligations. Processing for public health reasons is allowed if it serves a public interest. - **Children's Data**: The Act also safeguards children's privacy, requiring that personal data concerning children be processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act and that parents or legal guardians have reasonable supervision over their children's data. - **Restrictions on Processing**: Processing of personal data is restricted unless it is done with the data subject's consent, for legal claims, to protect others' rights, or for public interest. Data controllers must inform data subjects before withdrawing restrictions. 3. **Children Act**: The Children Act reinforces privacy by ensuring that children are not subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy or private affairs. Parents or legal guardians have the right to supervise their children's conduct and data. 4. **Practical Application**: In practice, privacy is enforced through legal mechanisms such as data protection officers, oversight bodies, and legal redress for violations. Data controllers and processors are required to implement mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act, including conducting data protection impact assessments and maintaining transparency in data processing activities. Individuals also have the right to challenge unlawful processing of their data and seek remedies under Kenyan law. In summary, privacy in Kenya is protected through constitutional guarantees, the Data Protection Act, and the Children Act, which together ensure that personal data is handled responsibly and that individuals have rights and remedies to protect their privacy.","[""37 - Commercial use of data"", ""3 - Object and purpose of this Act"", ""8 - Functions of the Office"", ""46 - Personal data relating to health"", ""52 - Journalism, literature and art"", ""25 - Principles of data protection""]","[""(1) A person shall not use, for commercial purposes, personal data obtained pursuant to the provisions of this Act unless the person— (a) has sought and obtained express consent from a data subject; or (b) is authorised to do so under any written law and the data subject has been informed of such use when collecting the data from the data subject.

What are the procedures for dealing with economic and social rights? for a claimant,Constitution of Kenya,43,"The procedures for dealing with economic and social rights for a claimant are governed by the Constitution of Kenya, specifically  43 and  44, which outline the enforcement and application of the Bill of Rights. While the exact procedures are not explicitly detailed in the provided context, the following can be inferred: 1. **Right to Institute Proceedings**: Under  44(1) of the Constitution, every person has the right to institute court proceedings to claim that a right or fundamental freedom in the Bill of Rights has been denied, violated, or infringed. This includes economic and social rights. 2. **Standing to Sue**:  44(2) allows for a wide range of persons to institute proceedings, including those acting on behalf of others, in the interest of a group, or in the public interest. This means that a claimant with an economic or social rights issue may have standing to bring a claim, even if they are not the sole affected party. 3. **Procedure and Formalities**:  44(3) states that the Chief Justice shall make rules to facilitate court proceedings, including ensuring that the procedures are kept to a minimum and that the court may entertain proceedings on the basis of informal documentation. This suggests that the process is designed to be accessible and not overly burdensome. 4. **No Fees for Commencing Proceedings**:  44(3)(c) specifies that no fee may be charged for commencing proceedings. This ensures that claimants are not deterred by financial barriers when seeking redress for economic and social rights violations. 5. **Interpretation in Favor of Rights**:  43(3) and (4) require courts to interpret the Bill of Rights in a way that promotes the values of an open and democratic society and to adopt the interpretation that most favours the enforcement of rights. This means that courts are expected to take a broad and protective approach when interpreting economic and social rights. 6. **Resources and Implementation**: If the State claims it lacks resources to implement a right,  43(5) requires the court to prioritize the widest possible enjoyment of the right, considering prevailing circumstances. This implies that courts may take into account the feasibility of resource allocation when addressing claims related to economic and social rights. In summary, while the specific procedures are not fully detailed in the provided context, the legal framework supports a process that is accessible, non-discriminatory, and focused on the protection and enforcement of economic and social rights.

How is charges and mortgages handled under the law? in practice,Land Act,79,"Under Kenyan law, as outlined in the Land Act (Act No. 28 of 2016), charges and mortgages are handled as follows: 1. **Application of the Act to Charges**: Part of the Land Act applies to all charges on land, including mortgages. However, the provisions of the Act do not affect the validity of any charge or mortgage that was valid before the Act came into effect. These existing charges remain valid in accordance with their terms, even if they conflict with the Act. 2. **Equity of Redemption**: The law prohibits any rule of law—written or unwritten—that allows a chargee to foreclose on the equity of redemption in charged land. This means that a chargee cannot take possession of the charged land or receive its rents and profits solely because of a default in payment, unless the Act provides for such action. 3. **Application of Proceeds of Sale**: If a chargee exercises the power of sale, the proceeds from the sale must be applied in a specific order of priority: - First, to pay any outstanding rates, taxes, or other charges on the land. - Second, to discharge any prior charges or encumbrances. - Third, to cover costs and expenses of the sale. - Fourth, to settle the outstanding amount under the charge, including interest and other sums due. - Fifth, to satisfy any subsequent charges in order of their priority. Any remaining funds are paid to the person entitled to discharge the charge. 4. **Discharge of Charges**: A chargor or any other person entitled to discharge the charge may do so at any time before the sale of the charged land. This can be done by paying the chargee the amount secured by the charge. Upon payment, the chargee must provide a discharge of the charge in the prescribed form. 5. **Priority of Charges**: Charges are ranked according to the order in which they were registered, unless otherwise stated in the charge instrument. Informal charges rank according to the order in which they were made, with registered informal charges taking priority over unregistered ones. If two charges are made or registered on the same day, the one first in time has priority. In cases of dishonesty or fraud by the chargor or a prior chargee, the prior chargee's right to repayment may be postponed in favor of the subsequent chargee.

This implies that for public authorities, the written contract or appointment may be presumed valid if it meets the legal requirements. 3. **Land Act**: For contracts involving the disposition of land, the Land Act (Act No. 28 of 2016, s. 55) provides that a contract is valid if it is in writing, signed by all parties, and attested by a witness who was present at the signing. This applies to public authorities as well, ensuring that any contract involving land must meet these formalities. 4. **Employment Act**: For contracts of service made abroad, the Employment Act provides that such contracts must be attested by a judge or magistrate and authenticated by the official seal of the court to which the judge or magistrate is attached.

What documents are needed to address agreements void for uncertainty? at the application stage,Law of Contract Act,6,"To address agreements void for uncertainty at the application stage, the following documents may be required: 1. **Written Instrument**: The agreement or disposition must be in writing, as many agreements, especially those involving property or legal rights, are required to be in writing under the Law of Contract Act. This ensures clarity and enforceability. 2. **Evidence of Oral Agreement**: Although oral agreements may not be admissible to contradict or vary the terms of a written document (under the Evidence Act), they may still be relevant to prove facts that invalidate the document, such as fraud, illegality, or mistake. 3. **Evidence of Legal Formalities**: If the agreement is subject to formal requirements (e.g., registration, attestation, or execution by a duly authorized representative), evidence of compliance with these formalities may be necessary to establish its validity. 4. **Evidence of Intent and Terms**: To counter a claim of uncertainty, the court may require evidence that the agreement expresses a definite intention and that its terms are clear and enforceable. This may include witness testimony or documentary evidence showing the parties' understanding of the agreement. 5. **Evidence of Conditions or Restrictions**: If the agreement includes conditions or restrictions that are challenged as void (e.g., conditions that are illegal, uncertain, or against public policy), evidence of those conditions and their legal implications may be required. 6. **Tax Documents (if applicable)**: If the agreement involves tax assessments or other documents, the Tax Procedures Act may require evidence that the document is valid in substance and effect, even if there are formal defects. In summary, the specific documents needed will depend on the nature of the agreement and the legal arguments raised. However, a written instrument, evidence of legal formalities, and documentation of the parties' intentions and terms are typically essential.","[""65 - Binding private rulings"", ""78 - Defect not to affect validity of tax assessments or other documents"", ""71 - Prescribed form"", ""3 - Interpretation"", ""41 - Procedure for obtaining order for possession"", ""6 - Confidentiality""]","[""(1) A taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner for a private ruling which shall set out the Commissioner's interpretation of a tax law in relation to a transaction entered into, or proposed to be entered into, by the taxpayer.

Additionally, the person who has intermeddled with the assets is answerable to the rightful executor or administrator, to the extent of the assets with which they have intermeddled, after deducting any payments made in the due course of administration. In practice, this means that any unauthorized interference with the deceased's property can result in legal consequences, including criminal penalties and civil liability to the rightful heirs or administrators. The law aims to protect the estate from unauthorized access or disposal, ensuring that the property is managed and distributed according to the law or the deceased's will.","[""26 - Provision for dependants not adequately provided for by will or on intestacy"", ""3 - Interpretation"", ""48 - Jurisdiction of Magistrates"", ""46 - Duties of officers in relation to protection, etc., of deceased's property"", ""71 - Confirmation of grants"", ""46 - Duties of officers in relation to protection, etc., of deceased's property""]","[""Where a person dies after the commencement of this Act, and so far as succession to his property is governed by the provisions of this Act, then on the application by or on behalf of a dependant, the court may, if it is of the opinion that the disposition of the deceased's estate effected by his will, or by gift in contemplation of death, or the law relating to intestacy, or the combination of the will, gift and law, is not such as to make reasonable provision for that dependant, order that such reasonable provision as the court thinks fit shall be made for that dependant out of the deceased's net estate.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to divorce in civil marriages? at registration,Marriage Act,66,"The safeguards that exist to protect rights relating to divorce in civil marriages are not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, based on the Constitution of Kenya and the Marriage Act, we can infer the following: 1. **Equality and Rights During Marriage**: Under the Constitution of Kenya, parties to a marriage are entitled to equal rights during the marriage. This implies that both parties have equal standing in matters such as divorce. 2. **Legal Recognition of Marriages**: The Marriage Act states that all marriages registered under this Act have the same legal status. This suggests that civil marriages are afforded equal legal protection, including in matters of divorce. 3. **Protection of Fundamental Rights**: The Constitution guarantees fundamental rights, including the right to marry and the right to equal treatment. These rights may indirectly protect individuals in divorce proceedings by ensuring that they are not discriminated against. 4. **Limitations on Rights**: The Constitution allows for limitations on rights in specific cases, such as for members of the Kenya Defence Forces or the National Police Service. However, this does not directly apply to civil marriages in general. In conclusion, while the specific safeguards for divorce rights in civil marriages are not explicitly outlined in the provided context, the legal framework suggests that civil marriages are protected under the principles of equality, legal recognition, and fundamental rights.","[""96 - Transitional Provisions"", ""51 - Appointment of marriage officers in foreign countries"", ""3 - Meaning of marriage"", ""94 - Provisions on delegated powers"", ""50 - Appointment of Registrar and Marriage officers"", ""6 - Kinds of marriages""]","[""(1) A person who, immediately before the date of commencement of this Act, was a Registrar of Marriages under the Marriage Act (Repealed) or the African Christian Marriage and Divorce Act (Repealed), or an assistant Registrar under the Islamic Marriage and Divorce Registration Act (Repealed), shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, send all registers of marriages and divorces to the Registrar.

Once maintenance proceedings have commenced, no further proceedings under any other Act may be filed without the Court's leave. 3. **Payment to a Third Party**: If the person in whose favor the maintenance order is made is not fit to receive the payments, has left the jurisdiction, is incapacitated, or has mismanaged the funds, the Court may appoint another person or institution to receive and administer the maintenance monies. The Court may also direct that the sums be secured in trust for the child. 4. **Enforcement of Maintenance Orders**: Any person, including the child, may apply to the Court for enforcement of a maintenance order if the respondent has failed to comply with the order or defaulted on payments. The Court may summon or arrest the respondent on a warrant. The Court may also require enquiries into the respondent’s means, including income, assets, and liabilities, to determine compliance. 5. **Interim Maintenance Orders**: The Court may issue an interim maintenance order on an ex-parte application if it is in the child’s best interests.

Who is entitled to relief concerning right to parental care? for an employer,Children Act,6,"The question appears to conflate two distinct legal concepts: **parental care** and **relief for insurance policies**. Based on the context provided, there is **no direct legal provision** that addresses **""relief concerning right to parental care""** for an employer. However, if the question is interpreted as asking about **parental responsibility** and **care of a child**, the relevant legal framework is provided in ** 4 of the Children Act**, which states: > ""(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the parents of a child shall have parental responsibility over the child on an equal basis, and neither the father nor the mother of the child shall have a superior right or claim against the other in exercise of such parental responsibility whether or not the child is born within or outside wedlock."" This means that **both parents** (or individuals with parental responsibility) have **equal rights** to the **care and upbringing** of the child, and neither parent can claim a superior right over the other. If the question is about **insurance relief** (e.g., for a child under an education or health policy), then ** 5 of the Income Tax Act** provides that: > ""(2) In this  'child', means any child of the resident individual and includes a step-child, an adopted child and an illegitimate child who was under the age of eighteen years on the date the premium was paid."" This means that **children** (including adopted children) are **included** in the definition of ""child"" for the purposes of **insurance relief**, but this does not directly address **parental care** or **employment-related rights**. ### Conclusion: There is **no provision** in the provided context that directly addresses **""relief concerning right to parental care""** for an employer.

How is pleas handled under the law? in practice,Criminal Procedure Code,137,"Under Kenyan law, as outlined in the Criminal Procedure Code (Act No. 13 of 1967, 1st Sch.), pleas are handled as follows: 1. **Plea of Autrefois Acquit or Autrefois Convict**: An accused person may plead that they have been previously convicted or acquitted of the same offence, or that they have obtained the President’s pardon for their offence. If such a plea is made and denied to be true, the court shall determine whether the plea is true or not. If the court finds the plea to be false or not supported by the facts, the accused is required to plead to the information. 2. **Plea of Guilty or Not Guilty**: The accused is required to plead not guilty, guilty, or guilty subject to a plea agreement. If the accused admits the truth of the charge (other than through a plea agreement), the court shall convict them and pass sentence unless there is sufficient cause to the contrary. If the accused does not admit the charge, the court proceeds to hear the case. If the accused refuses to plead, the court shall enter a plea of ""not guilty"" for them. 3. **Plea Agreement**: If the accused pleads guilty subject to a plea agreement, they are waiving their right to a full trial. The court must inform the accused of the nature of the charge, the maximum and minimum penalties, and the consequences of entering into a plea agreement, including the waiver of the right to appeal except in relation to the legality or extent of the sentence. 4. **Plea of Not Guilty**: If the accused pleads not guilty, the court proceeds to hear the case, and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The accused also has the right to remain silent and not to testify during the proceedings. In practice, the court ensures that the accused is fully informed of their rights and the implications of their plea, particularly in the case of a plea agreement. The court also has the authority to determine the truth of any plea of autrefois acquit or convict, and if the plea is found to be false, the accused is required to proceed with the trial.","[""3 - Trial of offences under Penal Code (Cap. 63) and under other laws"", ""279 - Plea of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict"", ""137 - Rules for the framing of charges and informations"", ""6 - Confidentiality"", ""137 - Rules for the framing of charges and informations"", ""324 - Motion in arrest of judgment""]","[""(1) All offences under the Penal Code (Cap. 63) shall be inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to this Code.

These returns must be in the form, manner, and within the time specified by the Commissioner. 3. **Accuracy and Reliability**: The Commissioner is not bound by the information provided by the taxpayer or on their behalf. Therefore, the taxpayer must ensure that the information submitted is accurate and reliable, as the Commissioner may use other available information to assess the taxpayer's tax liability. 4. **Compliance with Tax Laws**: The taxpayer must comply with all relevant tax laws, including those related to the electronic tax system. Failure to comply may result in penalties, such as a penalty of two times the tax due if the taxpayer fails to issue an electronic tax invoice, submit a tax return in electronic form, or pay tax electronically. 5. **Tax Compliance Certificate**: A taxpayer may apply for a Tax Compliance Certificate, which is valid for a specified period. The Commissioner may impose conditions for the issuance of such a certificate, and the taxpayer must comply with these conditions to maintain the certificate. 6. **Record Keeping and Tax Returns**: A taxpayer must keep proper records and file regular and reliable tax returns, as this is a condition for registration under the Value Added Tax Act.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to interest on late payment? at registration,Tax Procedures Act,77,"Based on the provided context, the following safeguards exist to protect rights relating to interest on late payment: 1. **Limitation on Aggregate Interest**: The accrued late payment interest shall not, in aggregate, exceed the principal tax liability. This ensures that interest does not accumulate beyond the principal amount, protecting taxpayers from excessive financial burden. 2. **Order of Payment**: When a taxpayer makes a payment that is less than the total amount of tax, penalty, and interest due, the amount paid is applied first to the tax liability, then to the penalty, and finally to the late payment interest. This ensures that the principal debt is prioritized over interest. 3. **Waiver of Interest**: The respective governments may waive the whole or part of any late payment of interest if the debtor provides a good and sufficient reason for the late payment. This provides a safeguard for taxpayers who have valid reasons for delayed payments. 4. **Notice Requirement**: If interest becomes payable, the national or county government must serve a notice on the debtor demanding payment of the interest in addition to other money then due. This ensures transparency and provides the debtor with an opportunity to respond. 5. **Non-Abatement of Interest**: The amount of any tax or late payment interest due and payable under a tax law shall not be abated by the prosecution of a taxpayer for an offence under a tax law. This ensures that interest remains enforceable regardless of criminal proceedings. These safeguards collectively protect the rights of taxpayers by ensuring that interest is not excessive, is applied in a fair order of priority, and can be waived or adjusted under certain conditions.","[""38 - Late payment interest"", ""29 - Unpaid rents and other payments"", ""38 - Late payment interest"", ""29 - Unpaid rents and other payments"", ""35 - Order of payment"", ""84 - Tax shortfall penalty""]","[""(1) Subject to sub (2), a person who fails to pay a tax on or before the due date for the payment of the tax shall be liable for late payment interest at a rate equal to one per cent per month or part of a month on the amount unpaid for the period commencing on the date the tax was due and ending on the date the tax is paid.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to filing returns? at registration,Value Added Tax Act,28,"The safeguards that exist to protect rights relating to filing returns and registration are as follows: 1. **Freedom of Association**: Under the Constitution of Kenya, every person has the right to freedom of association, which includes the right to form, join, or participate in the activities of an association. This right is protected, and no person shall be compelled to join an association. While this is not directly about filing returns, it indirectly supports the right of individuals and entities to engage in legal compliance without undue coercion. 2. **Reasonable Registration and Fair Hearing**: The Constitution also provides that any legislation requiring the registration of an association must ensure that registration may not be withheld or withdrawn unreasonably. Furthermore, there must be a right to have a fair hearing before registration is cancelled. This principle can be extended to the registration process for entities required to file returns, ensuring that the process is fair and not arbitrary. 3. **Procedural Safeguards in Tax Laws**: Under the Value Added Tax Act and the Tax Procedures Act, the Cabinet Secretary may make regulations for the better carrying into effect of the provisions of these Acts. These regulations may include conditions and procedures for registration and the submission of returns. Importantly, these regulations must be tabled before the National Assembly for approval before they take effect, ensuring that they are subject to legislative oversight and public accountability. 4. **Data Protection**: The Employment Act requires that registers of children in employment be maintained in accordance with the principles of data protection as set out in the Data Protection Act. While this applies specifically to employment registers, it reflects a broader principle that data related to compliance and registration must be handled with care and respect for privacy. In summary, the safeguards include fair and transparent registration procedures, the right to a fair hearing, legislative oversight of regulations, and adherence to data protection principles. These protections ensure that individuals and entities are not unfairly burdened or restricted in their rights to register and file returns.","[""112 - Regulations"", ""49 - Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya"", ""51 - General exemptions"", ""25 - Principles of data protection"", ""41 - Data protection by design or by default"", ""23 - Record-keeping""]","[""(1) The Cabinet Secretary may make Regulations for the better carrying into effect of the provisions of this Act.

How does one apply for relief concerning tenant’s remedies? during investigations,Distress for Rent Act,10,"To apply for relief concerning tenant’s remedies during investigations, one must follow the procedures outlined in the Land Act and other relevant legislation. Specifically: 1. **Application for Relief**: A tenant or any other interested party may apply to the court for relief against the exercise of remedies by the landlord or chargee. This application may be made at any time after the service of a notice under s 90(1), 91(2), 94(1), or 95(1), or during the exercise of any of the remedies contemplated in those s. 2. **Who Can Apply**: The application for relief may be made by the tenant (chargor), or if there are joint tenants, by one or more of them on their own behalf. A spouse of the tenant who was required to give consent to the creation of the charge but did not give consent may also apply. If the tenant has been adjudged bankrupt, the bankruptcy trustee of the tenant's estate may apply. 3. **Non-Admission of Breach**: An application for relief is not to be taken as an admission by the tenant or any other person applying for relief that there has been a breach of a covenant of the charge by the tenant, or that the chargee has the right to exercise the remedy in respect of which the application for relief has been made. 4. **Court’s Discretion**: The court may grant relief to the applicant on any terms and conditions that appear to the court to be just and reasonable. The court may also cancel the notice or oral communication and declare that the tenant is entitled to remain on the land, or it may postpone the operation of the notice or oral communication and grant the tenant a license to remain on the land. 5. **Relief Against Forfeiture**: If a notice has been served under  75, or if the lessor is proceeding by action or re-entry to enforce his right of forfeiture, the tenant may apply to the court for relief. The court may grant or refuse relief as it thinks fit, and if it grants relief, it may do so on such terms as it thinks fit. 6. **Inquiry into Declaration and Inventory**: If a superior landlord, or an agent employed by him, levies or proceeds with a distress on the goods, furniture, or chattels of the under-tenant or lodger after being served with the declaration and inventory, the tenant may apply to a subordinate court of the first or second class for an order for the restoration of those goods","[""103 - Application for relief by chargor"", ""103 - Application for relief by chargor"", ""42 - Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land"", ""15 - Distress for rent not unlawful for any irregularity"", ""90 - Remedies of a chargee"", ""104 - Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs""]","[""(1) An application for relief against the exercise by the chargee of any of the remedies referred to in  90(3) may be made by— (a) the chargor; (b) if two or more persons are joint chargors, by one or more of them on their own behalf; (c) a spouse of the chargor to the extent that the spouse was required to give consent to the creation of the charge but did not give consent; or (d) deleted by Act No. 28 of 2016, s. 75; (e) if the chargor has been adjudged bankrupt, the bankruptcy trustee of the estate of the charger.

How does one apply for relief concerning equality and freedom from discrimination? during investigations,Constitution of Kenya,27,"To apply for relief concerning equality and freedom from discrimination during investigations, one may approach the Kenya National Human Rights and Equality Commission (KNHREC), as it is empowered under the Constitution of Kenya to investigate complaints and issue summons for the purposes of its investigations. Specifically, under  12(3)(a) of the Constitution, the KNHREC has the authority to investigate complaints of discrimination and other human rights violations. If the complaint involves discrimination on the basis of race, sex, pregnancy, marital status, health status, ethnic or social origin, colour, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, dress, language, or birth, the complainant may file a formal complaint with the KNHREC. The Commission may then initiate an investigation, and if necessary, summon witnesses or relevant parties to assist in the process. Additionally, if the discrimination involves employment, land, or other specific areas covered by the Employment Act, Land Act, or Persons with Disabilities Act, the relevant statutory body (such as the Employment and Labour Relations Court or the National Land Commission) may also be approached for relief. In all cases, the complainant must ensure that the application for relief is made in accordance with the procedures outlined in the relevant legislation and that the complaint is supported by sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim of discrimination.","[""23 - Authority of courts to uphold and enforce the Bill of Rights"", ""24 - Limitation of rights and fundamental freedoms"", ""252 - General functions and powers"", ""24 - Limitation of rights and fundamental freedoms"", ""70 - Enforcement of environmental rights"", ""20 - Application of Bill of Rights""]","[""(1) The High Court has jurisdiction, in accordance with  165, to hear and determine applications for redress of a denial, violation or infringement of, or threat to, a right or fundamental freedom in the Bill of Rights.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to human dignity? at registration,Constitution of Kenya,28,"The safeguards that exist to protect rights relating to human dignity, including at registration, are as follows: 1. **Constitution of Kenya - Human Dignity**: Every person has inherent dignity and the right to have that dignity respected and protected. This is a fundamental principle enshrined in the Constitution, which applies to all individuals, including those registering for services or programs. 2. **Persons with Disabilities Act - Right to Human Dignity**: Every person with a disability has a right to human dignity and the right for that dignity to be respected and protected. This includes not being referred to by demeaning, embarrassing, derogatory, or any other term that may be considered as lowering their human dignity. This is particularly relevant during registration processes where individuals with disabilities may be identified or described. 3. **Persons with Disabilities Act - Right to Privacy**: Every person with a disability has a right to privacy and shall not be subjected to arbitrary interference or intrusion into their privacy, family, home, or correspondence. During registration, this means that personal information, including health and habilitation and rehabilitation services, must be handled with confidentiality and not shared without express authority. 4. **Children Act - Detention of Children in Conflict with the Law**: While this  primarily addresses detention, it also highlights that children deprived of liberty, including those with disabilities, must be accommodated in facilities that adequately meet their personal needs and that their privacy, legal capacity, and inherent human dignity must be respected. This principle can extend to registration processes involving children, ensuring that their dignity is upheld.

How is freedom of expression handled under the law? in practice,Constitution of Kenya,33,"Freedom of expression in Kenya is guaranteed under  33 of the Constitution, which enshrines the right of every person to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive, or impart information or ideas, freedom of artistic creativity, and academic freedom and freedom of scientific research. This right is broad and comprehensive, but it is not absolute. The Constitution explicitly limits this right in certain circumstances. Specifically, freedom of expression does not extend to propaganda for war, incitement to violence, hate speech, or advocacy of hatred that constitutes ethnic incitement, vilification of others, or incitement to cause harm. Additionally, such advocacy must be based on grounds of discrimination specified or contemplated in  27(4) of the Constitution. In practice, the exercise of freedom of expression must also respect the rights and reputation of others, as outlined in  33(3). This means that while individuals have the right to express their views, they must do so in a manner that does not infringe on the rights of others. Furthermore, the Constitution provides that the High Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine applications for redress of a denial, violation, or infringement of rights, including freedom of expression. This ensures that individuals can seek judicial remedies if their rights are violated. The media, both electronic and print, is also protected under the Constitution. Freedom and independence of the media are guaranteed, but this does not extend to expressions that are prohibited under  33(2). The State is prohibited from exercising control over or interfering with media, and it cannot penalize individuals for opinions or views expressed in media. State-owned media must be independent, impartial, and must afford fair opportunity for the presentation of divergent views and dissenting opinions. In summary, freedom of expression in Kenya is a fundamental right that is protected by the Constitution, but it is subject to certain limitations. These limitations are clearly defined and must be justified in accordance with constitutional principles. The judiciary plays a key role in upholding and enforcing this right, ensuring that it is exercised in a manner that respects the rights of others and aligns with the values of democracy and human rights.","[""33 - Freedom of expression"", ""34 - Freedom of the media"", ""23 - Authority of courts to uphold and enforce the Bill of Rights"", ""20 - Application of Bill of Rights"", ""24 - Limitation of rights and fundamental freedoms"", ""51 - Rights of persons detained, held in custody or imprisoned""]","[""(1) Every person has the right to freedom of expression, which includes— (a) freedom to seek, receive or impart information or ideas; (b) freedom of artistic creativity; and (c) academic freedom and freedom of scientific research.

What happens when access to justice arises? for a public authority,Constitution of Kenya,48,"When access to justice arises for a public authority, the State is required to ensure that justice is accessible and equitable for all persons, including those who are vulnerable or disadvantaged. Under the Constitution of Kenya, specifically  43 (Access to Justice), the State has a duty to provide reasonable access to justice, and if any fee is required, it must be reasonable and not impede access to justice. In addition, the Persons with Disabilities Act (PwD Act) reinforces this principle by guaranteeing effective access to justice for persons with disabilities, including through accommodations and free legal services in specific cases. The PwD Act also mandates the Chief Justice to make rules for the exemption of persons with disabilities from paying court fees in matters related to their rights. Furthermore, the Constitution of Kenya, under  43(4), states that if the State claims it does not have the resources to implement the right to access justice, courts and other authorities must prioritize the widest possible enjoyment of the right, taking into account the vulnerability of particular groups, including persons with disabilities. In summary, when access to justice arises for a public authority, the State must ensure that justice is accessible, equitable, and free from unreasonable fees. It must also provide accommodations and support for vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities, to ensure their effective participation in legal proceedings.","[""48 - Access to justice"", ""50 - Fair hearing"", ""50 - Fair hearing"", ""259 - Construing this Constitution"", ""50 - Fair hearing"", ""159 - Judicial authority""]","[""The State shall ensure access to justice for all persons and, if any fee is required, it shall be reasonable and shall not impede access to justice."", ""new and compelling evidence has become available.

What remedies are available in relation to values and principles of public service? on appeal,Constitution of Kenya,232,"Based on the provided context, the remedies available in relation to the values and principles of public service on appeal are not explicitly outlined. However, the Public Service Commission is empowered to evaluate and report on the extent to which these values and principles are complied with in the public service. Additionally, the Commission has the authority to hear and determine appeals in respect of county governments’ public service. While the specific remedies are not detailed in the context, the Employment Act outlines various factors that may be considered when recommending remedies for wrongful dismissal and unfair termination, including the wishes of the employee, the circumstances of the termination, and the employee's length of service. These factors may be relevant in determining appropriate remedies in cases where the values and principles of public service have been violated. Therefore, the available remedies on appeal would likely involve the Commission assessing whether the values and principles of public service were upheld and recommending appropriate actions, such as reinstatement, re-engagement, or compensation, depending on the circumstances.","[""232 - Values and principles of public service"", ""234 - Functions and powers of the Public Service Commission"", ""234 - Functions and powers of the Public Service Commission"", ""10 - National values and principles of governance"", ""73 - Responsibilities of leadership"", ""20 - Application of Bill of Rights""]","[""(1) The values and principles of public service include— (a) high standards of professional ethics; (b) efficient, effective and economic use of resources; (c) responsive, prompt, effective, impartial and equitable provision of services; (d) involvement of the people in the process of policy making; (e) accountability for administrative acts; (f) transparency and provision to the public of timely, accurate information; (g) subject to paragraphs (h) and (i), fair competition and merit as the basis of appointments and promotions; (h) representation of Kenya’s diverse communities; and (i) affording adequate and equal opportunities for appointment, training and advancement, at all levels of the public service, of— (i) men and women; (ii) the members of all ethnic groups; and (iii) persons with disabilities.

What remedies are available in relation to management of public land? on appeal,Land Act,9,"Based on the provided context, the remedies available in relation to the management of public land are not explicitly outlined. However, the following provisions may be relevant: 1. **Notice of Lease, License, or Agreement Action**: Under the Land Act, a notice must be published in the Gazette and at least two daily newspapers when public land is made available for use through lease, license, or agreement. This ensures transparency and public awareness of land use opportunities. 2. **Regulation of Land Use**: The Constitution allows the State to regulate land use in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public morality, public health, or land use planning. This implies that the State has the authority to manage public land in accordance with these objectives. 3. **Reversion of Land**: If a lessee of public land breaches any term or condition of the grant, the land may revert to the national or county government. This serves as a remedy to ensure compliance with land use conditions. 4. **Just Compensation**: In cases where public land is acquired, just compensation is determined based on factors such as the unexpired term of the lease, the value of developments on the land, and other criteria set by the Commission. While these provisions outline some remedies and management principles, the specific remedies available on appeal are not detailed in the context provided.

The acquiring authority must return the full amount paid as compensation. 2. **Notice of Acquisition**: Before the inquiry under  112(1) is appointed, the person interested in any plant or machinery attached to the land may serve a notice on the Commission to sever and remove the plant or machinery. 3. **Tribunal Review**: Matters relating to compulsory acquisition of land or creation of wayleaves, easements, and public right of way are referred to the Tribunal. The Tribunal has the power to confirm, vary, or quash the decision of the Commission. 4. **Right to Appeal**: A party dissatisfied with the Tribunal's decision may appeal to the court on grounds such as the decision being contrary to law, failure to determine a material issue, or a substantial error in procedure. 5. **Compensation Safeguards**: Just compensation must be paid promptly in full to all persons whose interests in the land have been determined. The acquiring authority must deposit compensation funds with the Commission before the acquisition is undertaken.

What are the requirements for compliance with oral evidence? for a private party,Evidence Act,63,"The requirements for compliance with oral evidence for a private party in Kenya are as follows: 1. **Direct Evidence**: Oral evidence must be direct. This means that the witness must personally perceive the fact in question and testify about it. For example, if a fact can be seen, the witness must say they saw it; if it can be heard, the witness must say they heard it, and so on. 2. **Verification of Written Evidence**: If a private party wishes to present written evidence, it must be verified by a statutory declaration. This ensures that the written evidence is credible and trustworthy. 3. **Oath or Affirmation**: Although the Small Claims Court Act allows for evidence to be given without oath, the court may require that evidence be given on oath if it deems it necessary. Therefore, a private party may be required to swear an oath or make an affirmation when giving oral evidence. 4. **Accessibility of the Witness**: The witness must be able to communicate in a manner that is intelligible. If the witness is unable to speak, they may give evidence through writing or signs, provided this is done in open court. 5. **Admissibility of Admissions**: If a private party wishes to prove an oral admission regarding the contents of a document, they must first establish that they are entitled to use secondary evidence under the Evidence Act. This is necessary unless the authenticity of the document is in question. 6. **Disclosure of Evidence**: The court must disclose all evidence and information received from any party to every other party involved in the proceedings. This ensures transparency and fairness in the legal process. These requirements ensure that oral evidence is credible, relevant, and properly verified, while also respecting the rights of all parties involved in the proceedings.","[""63 - Oral evidence must be direct."", ""20 - Statements by persons expressly referred to by party to suit."", ""126 - Dumb witnesses."", ""22 - Oral admissions as to contents of documents."", ""63 - Oral evidence must be direct."", ""171 - Document produced in answer to notice to be given as evidence if required.""]","[""an expert expressed in any treatise commonly offered for sale, and the grounds on which such opinion is held, may be proved by the production of such treatise if the author is dead or cannot be found, or has become incapable of giving evidence, or cannot be called as a witness without an amount of delay or expense which the court regards as unreasonable.

What remedies are available in relation to burden of proof? on appeal,Evidence Act,107,"In relation to the burden of proof on appeal, the following remedies are available: 1. **Burden on the Taxpayer**: Under the Tax Procedures Act, the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that a tax decision is incorrect. This means the taxpayer must provide evidence to show that the tax decision was wrong. 2. **Appeals on Questions of Law**: Appeals to the High Court or the Court of Appeal are limited to questions of law only. This means that the burden of proof on factual matters is not shifted to the court; instead, the focus is on legal interpretation. 3. **Grounds for Appeal**: In an appeal by a taxpayer to the Tribunal, High Court, or Court of Appeal, the taxpayer must rely only on the grounds stated in the objection to which the decision relates. Unless the Tribunal or Court allows the addition of new grounds, the taxpayer cannot introduce new factual or legal arguments. 4. **Burden of Proof in Criminal Cases**: In criminal cases, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. However, if the court is satisfied that the evidence creates a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt, the accused may be acquitted. On appeal, the burden remains with the prosecution to justify the verdict based on the evidence. 5. **Burden of Proof in Civil Cases**: In civil cases, the burden of proof lies with the party asserting a legal right or liability. The party must prove the existence of the facts that support their claim. In summary, on appeal, the burden of proof remains with the party seeking relief (whether the taxpayer or the accused), and the court will assess whether the burden has been met based on the evidence and legal arguments presented.","[""109 - Proof of particular fact."", ""107 - Burden of proof."", ""111 - Burden on accused in certain cases."", ""110 - Proof of admissibility."", ""47 - Proof that judgment was incompetent or obtained by fraud or collusion."", ""23 - PREVIOUS CONVICTION""]","[""The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person."", ""(1) Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.

How does one apply for relief concerning presumptions of fact? during investigations,Evidence Act,119,"The process of applying for relief concerning presumptions of fact during investigations is not directly addressed in the provided context. However, based on the relevant provisions, here is a general explanation: Presumptions of fact are governed under **[4] Evidence Act - Presumptions of fact**, which states that if a fact is declared by law to be conclusive proof of another, the court shall, on proof of the one fact, regard the other as proved, and shall not allow evidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it. If an application for relief is made during an investigation, the court may consider the presumptions of fact as part of its evaluation. The court has discretion under **[3] Evidence Act - Court to decide as to the admissibility of evidence**, where it may permit or require evidence to be given in a particular order, depending on the admissibility and relevance of the facts. Therefore, during an investigation, if presumptions of fact are involved, the court may rely on them as conclusive proof, unless disproven. If an application for relief is made, the court may consider the presumptions of fact as part of its determination, subject to the rules of admissibility and relevance outlined in the Evidence Act.","[""4 - Presumptions of fact."", ""144 - Court to decide as to the admissibility of evidence."", ""59 - Facts judicially noticed."", ""97 - Written contracts and grants."", ""36 - Weight to be attached to statement admissible under  35."", ""277 - Procedure in case of previous convictions""]","[""(1) Whenever it is provided by law that the court may presume a fact, it may either regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved, or may call for proof of it.

How is number of witnesses handled under the law? in practice,Evidence Act,143,"Under Kenyan law, the number of witnesses required to prove a fact is not specified in the absence of any specific legal provision. This means that the law does not impose a minimum or maximum number of witnesses that must be called to establish a fact in court. The court has discretion in determining the sufficiency of evidence based on the nature of the case and the evidence presented. In practice, the number of witnesses called depends on the complexity of the case, the nature of the evidence, and the burden of proof required. For example, in criminal cases, the prosecution must establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, which may require multiple witnesses to corroborate the facts. In contrast, in civil cases, the standard of proof is lower (on the balance of probabilities), and the number of witnesses may be fewer. Additionally, the court may adjourn the trial or take other steps to ensure the attendance of witnesses if they are not present, as outlined in the Criminal Procedure Code. The court may also consider the relevance and materiality of the testimony of each witness in determining whether the number of witnesses is sufficient to support the case.","[""143 - Number of witnesses."", ""211 - Defence"", ""23 - PREVIOUS CONVICTION"", ""306 - Close of case for prosecution"", ""72 - Proof where no attesting witness found."", ""211 - Defence""]","[""No particular number of witnesses shall, in the absence of any provision of law to the contrary, be required for the proof of any fact."", ""If the accused person states that he has witnesses to call but that they are not present in court, and the court is satisfied that the absence of those witnesses is not due to any fault or neglect of the accused person, and that there is a likelihood that they could, if present, give material evidence on behalf of the accused person, the court may adjourn the trial and issue process, or take other steps, to compel the attendance of the witnesses.
