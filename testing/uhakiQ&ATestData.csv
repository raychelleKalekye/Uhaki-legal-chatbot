How is human dignity handled under the law? in practice,Constitution of Kenya,Article 28,"Human dignity is a foundational principle in Kenyan law, enshrined in both the Constitution and specific legislation. Under the **Constitution of Kenya**, every person is guaranteed the right to inherent dignity and the right to have that dignity respected and protected (Constitution, **Article 28**). This principle is further reinforced in **Article 51**, which ensures that persons detained, held in custody, or imprisoned retain all rights and fundamental freedoms in the Bill of Rights, except where incompatible with their detention. It also mandates humane treatment and the right to petition for habeas corpus. The **Persons with Disabilities Act (PDA)** explicitly upholds the right to human dignity for persons with disabilities. **Section 16** of the PDA states that every person with a disability has the right to human dignity and that this dignity must be respected and protected. **Section 4** of the PDA outlines guiding principles, including respect for inherent dignity and individual autonomy, and the importance of accessibility and equality. These principles ensure that persons with disabilities are not only protected from demeaning treatment but also empowered to participate fully in society. In practice, the **Children Act** also safeguards human dignity, particularly for children in conflict with the law. **Section 26(6)** of the Children Act mandates that children deprived of liberty, including those with disabilities, must be treated humanely, with respect for their privacy, legal capacity, and dignity. Detention of children is to be a last resort, and they must have access to legal assistance and family contact. While these legal provisions establish a robust framework for protecting human dignity, the extent to which these rights are upheld in practice depends on the implementation of these laws by state organs, the judiciary, and civil society. Challenges such as lack of resources, systemic discrimination, and inadequate enforcement may hinder the full realization of these rights. Nonetheless, the legal framework clearly demonstrates that human dignity is a non-negotiable principle in Kenyan law.","[""Persons with Disabilities Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Constitution of Kenya"", ""Persons with Disabilities Act"", ""Constitution of Kenya"", ""Constitution of Kenya""]","[""16 – Right to Human Dignity - Right to Human Dignity"", ""26 – Detention of children in conflict with the law - Detention of children in conflict with the law"", ""28 – Human dignity - Human dignity"", ""3 – Guiding Values and Principles - Guiding Values and Principles"", ""51 – Rights of persons detained, held in custody or imprisoned - Rights of persons detained, held in custody or imprisoned"", ""19 – Rights and fundamental freedoms - Rights and fundamental freedoms""]","[""Every person with disability has a right to human dignity and the right for that dignity to be respected and protected and in particular not to be referred to by demeaning, embarrassing, derogatory and any other term that may be considered as lowering his or her human dignity."", ""of liberty or accommodated in child protection units shall be accommodated in facilities that adequately meet their personal needs, taking into account the condition and nature of the disability.

Furthermore, the Constitution provides that Parliament shall enact legislation to ensure the promotion of the principles of leadership and integrity and the enforcement of this Chapter (Constitution, Article 80(2)). This implies that legislative measures may include disciplinary actions, sanctions, or other remedies to address breaches of leadership and integrity standards. In addition, while not directly related to leadership and integrity, the Employment Act and Land Act provide general frameworks for remedies in cases of wrongful dismissal, unfair termination, and property-related disputes. These may serve as reference points for broader principles of accountability and redress, but they are not specifically tailored to leadership and integrity issues.

How does one apply for relief concerning values and principles of public service? during investigations,Constitution of Kenya,Article 232,"The application for relief concerning values and principles of public service during investigations is not directly addressed in the provided context. However, based on the legal framework, the Public Service Commission is mandated to evaluate and report on the extent to which the values and principles of public service, as outlined in Articles 10 and 232 of the Constitution, are complied with in the public service. This includes ensuring equitable access to opportunities, non-discrimination, and the promotion of transparency, accountability, and good governance. If an investigation into the application of these values and principles is underway, any party seeking relief would need to follow the procedures established under the Land Act for applications for relief, which may be applicable in cases involving land-related disputes or breaches of principles.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to contract of service? at registration,Employment Act,Section 9,"The safeguards to protect rights relating to contract of service at registration include the following: 1. **Written Contract Requirement**: Under the Employment Act, a contract of service that involves a period of three months or more, or the performance of specified work expected to take longer than three months, must be in writing. This ensures clarity and enforceability of the terms of employment (Employment Act, section 9(1)). 2. **Consent and Attestation**: An employee may consent to a written contract by signing it or imprinting a thumb or finger mark in the presence of a person other than the employer. If the employee is illiterate or does not understand the language of the contract, the employer must explain the contract in a language the employee understands (Employment Act, sections 9(3) and 9(4)). 3. **Enforceability of Foreign Contracts**: Contracts of service made abroad are enforceable in Kenya if they meet the requirements of the Employment Act, including being signed by the parties or attested by a judge or magistrate and authenticated by the official seal of the court (Employment Act, section 88(3)). 4. **Non-Discrimination and Reasonable Accommodation**: The Persons with Disabilities Act ensures that individuals with disabilities have the right to reasonable accommodation in employment, which includes the right to understand and participate in the contract of service (Persons with Disabilities Act, section 62). These safeguards ensure that employees are protected in their rights and that contracts of service are fair, transparent, and enforceable.","[""Employment Act"", ""Data Protection Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Value Added Tax Act"", ""Persons with Disabilities Act""]","[""9 – General provision of contract of service - General provision of contract of service"", ""49 – Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya - Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya"", ""35 – Termination notice - Termination notice"", ""88 – Saving of contracts of service made abroad - Saving of contracts of service made abroad"", ""37 – Offences relating to registration - Offences relating to registration"", ""62 – Discrimination contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution - Discrimination contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution""]","[""(1) A contract of service— (a) for a period or a number of working days which amount in the aggregate to the equivalent, of three months or more; or (b) which provides for the performance of any specified work which could not reasonably be expected to be completed within a period or a number of working days amounting in the aggregate to the equivalent of three months, shall be in writing.

How is annual leave handled under the law? in practice,Employment Act,Section 28,"Annual leave under the Employment Act is governed by section 28, which outlines the entitlement, duration, and conditions for annual leave. Employees are entitled to annual leave with pay, with the minimum being **21 days** per year of service, calculated as **one day for every 14 days of work** (section 28(1)(a)). One part of the annual leave must consist of **at least two uninterrupted working weeks** (section 28(4)). This uninterrupted part must be taken **within twelve consecutive months** of service, while the remainder of the annual leave may be taken **not later than eighteen months** after the end of the leave earning period (section 28(4)). If an employee is entitled to more than the minimum annual leave, the employer and employee may agree on how to utilize the additional leave days (section 28(5)). In practice, employers are required to maintain detailed records of annual leave entitlement, days taken, and days due, as stipulated in section 74(1)(f). These records must be available for inspection by authorized officers for the preceding thirty-six months (section 74(2)). Annual leave entitlement is also protected in the case of maternity leave, as an employee cannot forfeit annual leave for taking maternity leave (section 29(7)).

How is human dignity handled under the law? in practice,Constitution of Kenya,Article 28,"Human dignity is a foundational principle in Kenyan law, enshrined in both the Constitution and specific legislation. Under the **Constitution of Kenya**, every person is guaranteed the right to inherent dignity, which must be respected and protected (Constitution, **Article 28**). This right is further reinforced in **Article 51**, which ensures that persons detained, held in custody, or imprisoned retain all rights and fundamental freedoms, except where incompatible with their detention. It also mandates humane treatment and the right to petition for habeas corpus. The **Persons with Disabilities Act (PDA)** explicitly safeguards the dignity of persons with disabilities. **Section 16** of the PDA states that every person with a disability has the right to human dignity and that they must not be referred to by demeaning or derogatory terms. **Section 4** outlines guiding principles, including respect for inherent dignity and individual autonomy, as well as the right of children with disabilities to preserve their identities. In practice, the **Children Act (Section 26)** ensures that children in conflict with the law, including those with disabilities, are detained in facilities that meet their personal needs and are treated humanely. The Act mandates that detention be a last resort and that children have access to legal assistance and family contact. While these legal provisions establish a framework for protecting human dignity, their practical implementation depends on the enforcement by state organs, the judiciary, and civil society. Challenges may arise in ensuring compliance, particularly in cases involving persons with disabilities or children in custody. However, the law clearly mandates that dignity be upheld through legal protections, humane treatment, and the recognition of individual rights.","[""Persons with Disabilities Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Constitution of Kenya"", ""Persons with Disabilities Act"", ""Constitution of Kenya"", ""Constitution of Kenya""]","[""16 – Right to Human Dignity - Right to Human Dignity"", ""26 – Detention of children in conflict with the law - Detention of children in conflict with the law"", ""28 – Human dignity - Human dignity"", ""3 – Guiding Values and Principles - Guiding Values and Principles"", ""51 – Rights of persons detained, held in custody or imprisoned - Rights of persons detained, held in custody or imprisoned"", ""19 – Rights and fundamental freedoms - Rights and fundamental freedoms""]","[""Every person with disability has a right to human dignity and the right for that dignity to be respected and protected and in particular not to be referred to by demeaning, embarrassing, derogatory and any other term that may be considered as lowering his or her human dignity."", ""of liberty or accommodated in child protection units shall be accommodated in facilities that adequately meet their personal needs, taking into account the condition and nature of the disability.

What remedies are available in relation to leadership and integrity? on appeal,Constitution of Kenya,Article 73,"The remedies available in relation to leadership and integrity, as outlined in the Constitution of Kenya, are primarily governed by Chapter 6, which deals with leadership and integrity.

Furthermore, the Constitution requires Parliament to enact legislation to apply the principles of leadership and integrity to public officers (Constitution, Article 80(3)). These legislative measures would likely include specific remedies such as disciplinary actions, sanctions, or other appropriate measures to ensure accountability and uphold the standards of leadership and integrity.

How does one apply for relief concerning values and principles of public service? during investigations,Constitution of Kenya,Article 232,"The application for relief concerning values and principles of public service during investigations is not directly addressed in the provided context. However, based on the relevant legal framework, the Public Service Commission is mandated to evaluate and report on the extent to which the values and principles of public service, as outlined in Articles 10 and 232 of the Constitution, are complied with in the public service. If an investigation into the application of these values and principles is underway, any individual or entity affected by the findings of the investigation may seek relief through the appropriate legal channels, such as filing an application with the Public Service Commission or relevant judicial body. The process for seeking relief would generally involve submitting a formal application, providing evidence of the alleged breach, and demonstrating how the breach affects the rights or interests of the applicant. In cases involving land disputes or other matters governed by the Land Act, relief may be sought under the procedures outlined in the Land Act, such as applying for relief by chargor.

How is annual leave handled under the law? in practice,Employment Act,Section 28,"Annual leave under the Employment Act is governed by section 28, which outlines the entitlement, duration, and conditions for annual leave. Employees are entitled to annual leave with pay, with the minimum period specified in subsection (1)(a). One part of the annual leave, as agreed under subsection (2), must consist of at least two uninterrupted working weeks. This uninterrupted part of the annual leave must be granted and taken during the twelve consecutive months of service referred to in subsection (1)(a). The remainder of the annual leave may be taken not later than eighteen months from the end of the leave earning period. If an employee is entitled to more than the minimum annual leave, the employer and employee may agree on how to utilize the leave days under subsection (5). Additionally, maternity leave does not affect an employee's annual leave entitlement under section 29(7). In practice, employers are required to maintain detailed records of annual leave entitlement, days taken, and days due under section 74(1)(f). These records must be available for inspection by an authorized officer for the preceding thirty-six months.

Who is entitled to relief concerning maternity leave? for an employer,Employment Act,Section 29,"Under the Employment Act, a female employee is entitled to maternity leave, which includes three months of maternity leave with full pay. Upon expiry of the maternity leave, the employee has the right to return to the job she held immediately prior to her maternity leave or to a reasonably suitable job on terms and conditions not less favourable than those which would have applied had she not been on maternity leave. Regarding relief concerning maternity leave for an employer, it is important to note that the question appears to conflate maternity leave entitlements with insurance relief. The Insurance Relief provisions under the Income Tax Act do not directly relate to maternity leave for employers. Therefore, based on the context provided, there is no specific legal provision that grants relief concerning maternity leave for an employer. If the question refers to incentives for employers in relation to employing persons with disabilities, then under the Persons with Disabilities Act, a private employer who engages a person with a disability is entitled to deductions from its taxable income. However, this is not related to maternity leave.

If the termination is unfair, the employee may file a complaint under **section 47(1)** within three months of dismissal. The labour officer will then investigate and recommend a resolution.

How does one apply for relief concerning management of public land? during investigations,Land Act,Section 9,"The process for applying for relief concerning the management of public land is not directly outlined in the provided context. However, based on the relevant provisions of the Land Act, relief concerning the management of public land may be sought through the courts under the broader framework of relief against rescission of contracts for the sale of land, as set out in **Land Act, section 42**. If the management of public land has been affected by a breach of contract or other legal issues, the affected party may apply to the court for relief under **section 42(1)**, which allows for relief against rescission of the contract either in the proceedings for an order for possession or in proceedings brought by the purchaser. For matters specifically related to the management of public land, such as disputes over the allocation, use, or control of public land, the affected party may also seek relief through the Commission or the courts, as the Commission has the authority to approve or vary management plans under **section 17(3)** and **section 16(1)** of the Land Act. If the issue involves environmental or heritage concerns, the Commission is required to consider these in the development of management plans under **section 17(2)**. In summary, relief concerning the management of public land may be sought through the Commission or the courts, depending on the nature of the dispute and the applicable provisions of the Land Act.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to allocation of land? at registration,Land Act,Section 24,"The safeguards to protect rights relating to the allocation of land include the following: 1. **Notice Requirements**: Before allocating public land, the Commission must publish a notice in the Gazette and in a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the land. The notice must specify the place, date, and time of allocation, the appraised value of the land, and describe each parcel of land to be allocated. This ensures transparency and allows interested parties to participate in the allocation process (Land Act, s. 14(7)). 2. **Pre-emptive Rights of Lessees**: Lessees of land have pre-emptive rights to extend their leases or be reallocated the land, subject to the rules and regulations set by the Commission. These rules may include procedures for lease extension, factors for determining lease extension, and the payment of stand premium or annual rent. This protects the rights of lessees in the allocation process (Land Act, s. 13). 3. **Conservation and Sustainable Use**: The Commission is required to make rules for the sustainable conservation of land-based natural resources. These rules may include measures to protect critical ecosystems, incentives for communities to invest in conservation, and procedures for the registration and management of natural resources. This ensures that land allocation does not compromise environmental sustainability or the rights of communities (Land Act, s. 19). 4. **Data Protection**: Although not directly related to land allocation, the Data Protection Act provides safeguards for personal data, including consent and appropriate safeguards before transferring sensitive data out of Kenya. This is relevant if personal data of landholders or stakeholders is involved in the allocation process (Data Protection Act, s. 49). These safeguards collectively ensure that the rights of landholders, lessees, and communities are protected throughout the allocation and registration process.","[""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Data Protection Act""]","[""12 – Allocation of public land - Allocation of public land"", ""14 – Notification requirements applicable to allocation of public land - Notification requirements applicable to allocation of public land"", ""13 – Lessee pre-emptive rights to allocation - Lessee pre-emptive rights to allocation"", ""19 – Conservation of land based natural resources - Conservation of land based natural resources"", ""2 – Interpretation - Interpretation"", ""49 – Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya - Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya""]","[""land that has been identified for allocation does not fall within any of the following categories— (a) public land that is subject to erosion, floods, earth slips or water logging; (b) public land that falls within forest and wild life reserves, mangroves, and wetlands or fall within the buffer zones of such reserves or within environmentally sensitive areas; (c) public land that is along watersheds, river and stream catchments, public water reservoirs, lakes, beaches, fish landing areas riparian and the territorial sea as may be prescribed; (d) public land that has been reserved for security, education, research and other strategic public uses as may be prescribed; and (e) natural, cultural, and historical features of exceptional national value falling within public lands; (f) reserved land; or (g) any other land categorized as such, by the Commission, by an order published in the Gazette.

What timelines apply when dealing with oral evidence? at the hearing stage,Evidence Act,Section 63,"When dealing with oral evidence at the hearing stage, the following timelines apply: 1. **Oral wills**: Under the Law of Succession Act, an oral will is only valid if it is made before two or more competent witnesses, and the testator dies within three months from the date of making the will. However, if the testator is a member of the armed forces or merchant marine during active service, the oral will remains valid even if the testator dies more than three months after making the will (Law of Succession Act, Section 9(1)). 2. **Evidence of oral agreements**: Under the Evidence Act, if the terms of a contract or disposition of property have been proved, no evidence of an oral agreement contradicting, varying, or adding to the document's terms may be admitted. However, evidence of an oral agreement that does not contradict the document's terms, or that constitutes a condition precedent to an obligation under the document, may be admitted (Evidence Act, Section 98(1)(ii) and (iii)). 3. **General oral evidence**: The Evidence Act provides that oral evidence must be direct (Evidence Act, Section 63(1)). This means that a witness must personally perceive or experience the fact in question and testify to it. There is no specific timeline mentioned for oral evidence in general, but the evidence must be direct and relevant to the issue at hand. In summary, the timelines for oral evidence are primarily governed by the specific context of the case, such as the validity of an oral will or the admissibility of oral agreements. In the absence of specific statutory timelines for general oral evidence, the admissibility and relevance of the evidence are determined by the rules of direct evidence and the nature of the case.","[""Law of Succession Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Law of Succession Act"", ""Criminal Procedure Code""]","[""10 – Proof of oral wills - Proof of oral wills"", ""63 – Oral evidence must be direct. - Oral evidence must be direct."", ""62 – Oral evidence. - Oral evidence."", ""98 – Evidence of oral agreement. - Evidence of oral agreement."", ""9 – Oral wills - Oral wills"", ""358 – Power to take further evidence - Power to take further evidence""]","[""If there is any conflict in evidence of witnesses as to what was said by the deceased in making an oral will, the oral will shall not be valid except so far as its contents are proved by a competent independent witness.

What remedies are available in relation to documentary evidence? on appeal,Evidence Act,Section 65,"In relation to documentary evidence on appeal, the following remedies are available: 1. **Admissibility of Documentary Evidence**: Under the **Evidence Act, Section 35(1)**, documentary evidence is admissible if it tends to establish a fact in issue and the maker of the statement either had personal knowledge of the matters dealt with or, where the document forms part of a continuous record, made the statement in the performance of a duty to record information from a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge. This standard applies to documentary evidence in both original and appellate proceedings. 2. **Power to Take Further Evidence**: Under the **Criminal Procedure Code, Section 358(1)**, the High Court may take further evidence, including documentary evidence, if it deems additional evidence necessary for an appeal. The High Court may either take the evidence itself or direct a subordinate court to do so. The evidence is treated as if it were taken at a trial before a subordinate court. 3. **Evidence in Reply**: If the accused introduces new documentary evidence in their defence that the prosecutor could not reasonably have foreseen, the court may allow the prosecutor to adduce evidence in reply to rebut the new matter (under **Criminal Procedure Code, Section 309** or **Section 212**). 4. **Court’s Discretion on Admissibility**: The court has discretion under **Evidence Act, Section 144(4)** to determine the admissibility of documentary evidence, including whether evidence of one fact may be given before another fact is proved, or vice versa, depending on the circumstances.

How does one apply for relief concerning burden of proof? during investigations,Evidence Act,Section 107,"To apply for relief concerning the burden of proof during investigations, one must understand the legal framework governing the burden of proof and the specific procedures for seeking relief in the context of a charge or legal claim. Under the **Evidence Act**, the burden of proof generally lies on the party asserting a fact, unless otherwise specified by law (Evidence Act 107(1) and 109). In the context of **Land Act 103**, relief against the exercise of remedies by a chargee can be sought by the chargor or other specified parties, such as a spouse or bankruptcy trustee, provided the application is made in accordance with the procedural requirements set out in the Act. In **civil proceedings**, including those involving the burden of proof, the party claiming exemption from liability or the existence of certain facts must bear the burden of proof (Evidence Act 109 and Value Added Tax Act 62). If the application for relief is made during investigations, it must be done in compliance with the procedural rules of the relevant Act, and the burden of proof may shift depending on the nature of the claim or defense. In summary, applying for relief concerning the burden of proof during investigations requires adherence to the procedural rules of the applicable law, particularly the **Land Act** and **Evidence Act**, and the party seeking relief must demonstrate the existence of the facts supporting their claim.","[""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Value Added Tax Act"", ""Evidence Act""]","[""107 – Burden of proof. - Burden of proof."", ""108 – Incidence of burden. - Incidence of burden."", ""103 – Application for relief by chargor - Application for relief by chargor"", ""109 – Proof of particular fact. - Proof of particular fact."", ""62 – Burden of proof - Burden of proof"", ""111 – Burden on accused in certain cases. - Burden on accused in certain cases.""]","[""(1) Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to onus of proof? at registration,Evidence Act,Section 109,"The safeguards relating to the onus of proof in the context of registration are not explicitly outlined in the provided context. However, under the **Evidence Act, Section 107(1)**, it is stated that ""whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist."" This means that the **burden of proof lies on the party asserting a fact**, ensuring that the rights of individuals are protected by requiring that claims be substantiated. In the context of **registration**, if a person is required to register under the **Value Added Tax Act**, and they fail to do so, they may be liable for an offence.

How is evidence of accomplice handled under the law? in practice,Evidence Act,Section 124,"Under Kenyan law, evidence of an accomplice is handled as follows: An accomplice is considered a competent witness and can provide evidence against an accused person.

However, the evidence of an accomplice is generally treated with caution due to potential bias or interest in the outcome.

What happens when cross-examination arises? for a public authority,Evidence Act,Section 164,"When cross-examination arises for a public authority, it is subject to the same legal principles that apply to all parties in a legal proceeding.

Additionally, **Evidence Act, Section 156** provides that a person charged with an offence, even if called as a witness for the defence, may be cross-examined on any matter, including those that may incriminate them.

This ensures that all witnesses, regardless of their affiliation, are subject to scrutiny during cross-examination.

What remedies are available in relation to contracts made without consideration? on appeal,Law of Contract Act,Section 7,"The question of remedies for contracts made without consideration is not directly addressed in the provided context. However, based on the legal provisions given, the following general principles may apply: 1. **Validity of Contracts**: Under **Land Act, Section 38(1)**, a contract for the disposition of land must be in writing, signed by all parties, and attested by a witness. If a contract lacks these formalities, it may be deemed invalid. This principle may extend to other types of contracts, depending on the applicable law. 2. **Remedies for Breach of Contract**: Under **Employment Act, Section 49**, remedies for wrongful dismissal or unfair termination include reinstatement, re-engagement, compensation, and other forms of redress. While this section specifically addresses employment contracts, it reflects the general principle that remedies for breach of contract may include compensation and other equitable remedies. 3. **Appeals and Legal Remedies**: Under **Tax Procedures Act, Section 54**, a party dissatisfied with a High Court decision may appeal to the Court of Appeal within 30 days. Similarly, **Criminal Procedure Code, Section 175** outlines the process for compensation orders, which may be relevant in cases involving civil liability arising from contractual breaches. 4. **General Legal Principles**: In the absence of specific provisions on contracts made without consideration, the courts may apply general principles of contract law, including the doctrine that a contract must have consideration to be valid. If a contract lacks consideration, it may be void, and remedies may be limited to restitution or compensation for any damages suffered. In summary, while the specific issue of remedies for contracts made without consideration is not explicitly addressed in the context, the available legal principles suggest that such contracts may be deemed invalid, and remedies would depend on the nature of the breach and the applicable law. If the contract is void, remedies may be limited to restitution or compensation for any damages.

What penalties apply where there is a breach relating to illegal contracts? during enforcement,Law of Contract Act,Section 10,"In the context of breaches relating to illegal contracts, the relevant legal provisions are found in the **Employment Act** and the **Land Act**. Under **section 88(1)** of the **Employment Act**, it is stated that an employer or employee may enforce their rights and remedies for any breach or non-performance of a lawful contract of service made outside Kenya. However, this does not apply to illegal contracts. Regarding **illegal contracts**, the **Land Act** provides that if a contract is not in conformity with the Act, it may not be enforced. Specifically, **section 42(2)** of the **Land Act** states that a contract not in conformity with the Act shall not be enforced as against an employee who is unable to read and understand the contract. If a contract is made in a foreign country, it must be attested by a judge or magistrate and authenticated by the official seal of the court to be enforceable in Kenya. In the context of **enforcement**, **section 3(1)** of the **Data Protection Act** outlines that a person who fails to comply with an enforcement notice may be liable to a fine not exceeding five million shillings or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both. However, this provision applies specifically to breaches of the Data Protection Act and not directly to illegal contracts. In summary, the penalties for breaches relating to illegal contracts are not explicitly outlined in the provided context.

How does one apply for relief concerning specific performance? during investigations,Law of Contract Act,Section 13,"The application for relief concerning specific performance is not directly addressed in the provided context. However, based on the legal framework in Kenya, specific performance is generally considered an extraordinary remedy and is only granted in exceptional circumstances. Under the common law principle mentioned in **Employment Act, section 49(d)**, courts are instructed not to order specific performance in a contract of service except in very exceptional circumstances. If the issue pertains to a lease or land contract, **Land Act, section 76(1)** allows a lessee who has received a notice of forfeiture to apply to the court for relief. While this section does not explicitly mention specific performance, it provides a mechanism for applying for relief against forfeiture, which may be relevant in certain contexts. For other types of contracts, the general rule is that specific performance is not typically available, and the court will consider the unique circumstances of the case before granting relief. Since the context does not provide specific provisions on applying for relief concerning specific performance, the answer is based on general legal principles and related sections.","[""Land Act"", ""Income Tax Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Children Act""]","[""103 – Application for relief by chargor - Application for relief by chargor"", ""31 – Insurance relief - Insurance relief"", ""42 – Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land - Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land"", ""49 – Remedies for wrongful dismissal and unfair termination - Remedies for wrongful dismissal and unfair termination"", ""76 – Relief against forfeiture - Relief against forfeiture"", ""230 – Levels of diversion - Levels of diversion""]","[""(1) An application for relief against the exercise by the chargee of any of the remedies referred to in section 90(3) may be made by— (a) the chargor; (b) if two or more persons are joint chargors, by one or more of them on their own behalf; (c) a spouse of the chargor to the extent that the spouse was required to give consent to the creation of the charge but did not give consent; or (d) deleted by Act No. 28 of 2016, s. 75; (e) if the chargor has been adjudged bankrupt, the bankruptcy trustee of the estate of the charger.

How is inheritance by spouse and children handled under the law? in practice,Law of Succession Act,Section 35,"Under Kenyan law, the inheritance rights of a surviving spouse and children are governed by the **Law of Succession Act (Cap. 160)** and the **Children Act (Cap. 14)**. Here is a legal summary of how inheritance is handled in the presence of both a surviving spouse and children: 1. **Surviving Spouse and Children**: If the deceased has left a surviving spouse and one or more children, the **whole residue of the net intestate estate** shall devolve upon the surviving child or children, **equally divided** among them, **upon the death or remarriage of the surviving spouse** (Section 7(5) of the Law of Succession Act). This means the surviving spouse's share is limited to the personal and household effects of the deceased and a life interest in the residue of the estate, which terminates upon their death or remarriage. 2. **Equal Treatment of Children**: Every child has the **right to inherit property** in accordance with the Law of Succession Act (Section 17(1) of the Children Act). No child may be **disinherited** on grounds such as age, sex, or social status (Section 17(2)). Any attempt to disinherit a child may constitute an **offence**, with penalties including imprisonment or fines (Section 17(3)). 3. **Protection of Children's Rights**: The **Children Act** ensures that children are **entitled to full restitution** of property or benefits that are due to them under the law of succession. This includes **restitution** if a child has been wrongfully deprived of their inheritance (Section 17(4)). 4. **Priority of Inheritance**: If there is **no surviving spouse**, the estate is distributed among the **children**, and if there are **no children**, the estate passes to the **kindred** of the deceased in a specific order of priority (Section 39 of the Law of Succession Act). In practice, the **surviving spouse** is entitled to a **life interest** in the residue of the estate, but this interest terminates upon their **death or remarriage**. The **children**, on the other hand, are **entitled to an equal share** of the residue of the estate after the spouse's interest has terminated.

What happens when petition for grant arises? for a public authority,Law of Succession Act,Section 51,"When a petition for a grant arises for a public authority, the following legal considerations apply under Kenyan law: 1. **Application for Grant**: Under **Law of Succession Act, Section 51(1)**, every application for a grant of representation must be made in a prescribed form, signed by the applicant and witnessed in the prescribed manner. If the public authority is the applicant, it must ensure compliance with these formalities. 2. **Notice of Application**: **Law of Succession Act, Section 67(1)** requires that notice of the application for a grant be published, inviting objections. This notice must be exhibited in the court-house and published in such other manner as the court directs. The notice period must be at least thirty days, during which objections can be made. 3. **Continuing Trust**: If a continuing trust arises, **Law of Succession Act, Section 12(1)(a)** and **Section 12(2)** provide that no grant of letters of administration shall be made to one person alone, unless that person is the Public Trustee or a Trust Corporation. If the public authority is the applicant, it must ensure that the grant is not issued to a single person unless it meets the exception in Section 12(1)(a). 4. **Confirmation of Grant**: **Law of Succession Act, Section 71(1)** and **Section 71(2A)** require that the court confirms the grant only after ensuring that all persons beneficially entitled to the estate are identified and their shares specified.

How is annulment handled under the law? in practice,Marriage Act,Section 69,"Under Kenyan law, annulment of marriage is handled as follows: 1. **Grounds for Annulment**: A party to a marriage may petition the court to annul the marriage on specific grounds, including failure to consummate the marriage, prohibited relationships, bigamy, lack of free consent, absence of one party at the time of marriage, pregnancy of one party without the husband's responsibility, or insanity of one party without the petitioner's knowledge (Marriage Act, sections 73(1)). 2. **Time Limit**: The petition for annulment must be made within one year of the marriage's celebration (Marriage Act, section 73(2)(a)). 3. **Ignorance of Facts**: The court will only grant an annulment if the petitioner was ignorant of the facts at the time of the marriage, particularly in cases of prohibited relationships or bigamy (Marriage Act, section 73(2)(b)). 4. **Effect of Annulment**: Upon annulment, the parties are deemed never to have been married. However, the annulment does not affect the legality of actions taken during the marriage, such as debts or witness competence (Marriage Act, section 74). 5. **Registration**: A certified copy of the annulment decree must be delivered to the Registrar, who will register the annulment in the appropriate register (Marriage Act, section 60). In practice, annulment is a formal legal process that requires strict adherence to procedural and substantive requirements, including timely filing and proof of ignorance of certain facts.","[""Marriage Act"", ""Marriage Act"", ""Marriage Act"", ""Marriage Act"", ""Marriage Act"", ""Marriage Act""]","[""72 – Registration of divorce under Islamic law - Registration of divorce under Islamic law"", ""16 – Duration of marriage - Duration of marriage"", ""73 – Grounds for annulment of marriage - Grounds for annulment of marriage"", ""75 – Effect of a decree of annulment - Effect of a decree of annulment"", ""60 – Copies of decrees of annulment and divorce to be sent to Registrar - Copies of decrees of annulment and divorce to be sent to Registrar"", ""74 – Party to petition for annulment of marriage - Party to petition for annulment of marriage""]","[""Where a Kadhi, sheikh, imam or person authorised by the Registrar grants a decree for the dissolution of a marriage celebrated under Part VII, the Kadhi, sheikh, imam, Mukhi or authorised person shall deliver a copy of the decree to the Registrar.

Who is entitled to relief concerning maintenance orders? for an employer,Marriage Act,Section 70,"The question appears to conflate two distinct legal areas: maintenance orders and incentives for employers of persons with disabilities. Regarding maintenance orders, **Section 121(1) of the Children Act** provides that any person, including a child in whose favor a maintenance order has been made, may apply to the Court for the enforcement of the order if the person against whom the order was made has failed to comply with its provisions or defaulted in any payment specified under the order. As for the entitlement of an employer to relief, this is addressed under **Section 23 of the Persons with Disabilities Act**, which provides that a private employer who engages a person with a disability is entitled to a tax deduction of 25% of the total amount paid as salary and wages to such employee, subject to certain conditions. This relief is distinct from maintenance orders and applies specifically to employers of persons with disabilities. Therefore, the entitlement to relief concerning maintenance orders is governed by **Section 121 of the Children Act**, while the entitlement of an employer to relief is governed by **Section 23 of the Persons with Disabilities Act**.","[""Children Act"", ""Persons with Disabilities Act"", ""Income Tax Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act""]","[""121 – Enforcement of orders for maintenance or contribution - Enforcement of orders for maintenance or contribution"", ""23 – Incentive for private employer - Incentive for private employer"", ""31 – Insurance relief - Insurance relief"", ""103 – Application for relief by chargor - Application for relief by chargor"", ""117 – Interim orders of maintenance - Interim orders of maintenance"", ""115 – Power to order maintenance monies to be paid to person other than the applicant - Power to order maintenance monies to be paid to person other than the applicant""]","[""(1) Any person, including a child in whose favour a maintenance order has been made pursuant to section 111, may apply to the Court for the enforcement of the order and recovery of any sums due and payable thereunder if— (a) the person against whom the maintenance order was made has failed to comply with any provision contained in the order; or (b) the person against whom the order was made has defaulted in any payment specified under the order.

During investigations, the court may be involved in assessing the suitability of the adoption, ensuring the child's best interests are upheld, and determining whether the adoption order should be granted. The **guardian ad litem**, appointed under **Children Act, section 188(1)**, plays a critical role in safeguarding the child's interests and reporting to the court on the facts and circumstances of the adoption. If there are concerns about the adequacy of the investigation or the suitability of the adoption, the court may grant relief in the form of additional inquiries, reconsideration of the adoption order, or other protective measures. Relief may also be sought by the child, the parent, or any other qualified person under **Children Act, section 134(2)**, provided the application is made in the child's best interests. If the investigation reveals that the adoption is not in the child's best interests, the court may revoke the adoption order or grant joint custody, as outlined in **Children Act, section 190(1)-(3)**. In summary, relief concerning the powers of the court in adoption proceedings during investigations is sought through the court's authority to make orders under **Children Act, section 134**, with the guardian ad litem and other qualified persons playing key roles in ensuring the child's welfare.","[""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Land Act""]","[""194 – Powers of the Court in adoption proceedings - Powers of the Court in adoption proceedings"", ""134 – Power of Court to make orders in certain proceedings - Power of Court to make orders in certain proceedings"", ""210 – Functions of adoption societies - Functions of adoption societies"", ""188 – Appointment of guardian ad litem for purposes of adoption - Appointment of guardian ad litem for purposes of adoption"", ""190 – Review of adoption - Review of adoption"", ""42 – Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land - Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land""]","[""(1) Before making an adoption order, the Court shall inquire into and be satisfied on evidence before it that— (a) every person whose consent is required under this Part, which consent has not been dispensed with, has consented to and understands the nature and effect of the adoption order for which the application is made; (b) in the case of a parent, the parent understands that the effect of the adoption order is to permanently deprive him or her of his or her parental rights; (c) if made, the order will be in the best interests of the child, having regard to the wishes of the child, depending on the child’s age and understanding, and to the ability of the applicant to maintain and educate the child; (d) the applicant has not received or agreed to receive, and that no person had made or given or agreed to make or give to the applicant, any payment or other reward in consideration of the adoption; (e) any person whose consent is dispensed with on the grounds of incapacity is still incapable of giving consent at the date of making the order; (f) where the applicant is not a relative of the child, reasonable steps have been taken to inform the relatives of the child of the proposed adoption, and no relative"", ""(1) The Court may make any order under this Act or any other written law for the protection of a child in any proceedings concerning the welfare and upbringing of the child.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to arrest without warrant? at registration,Criminal Procedure Code,Section 29,"There are several safeguards in Kenyan law to protect the rights of individuals relating to arrest without a warrant: 1. **Reasonable Grounds for Suspicion**: A police officer may only arrest without a warrant if there are reasonable grounds to suspect the person of having committed a cognizable offence, or if the person is involved in a breach of peace, obstruction of a police officer, or other specific circumstances outlined in **Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) section 29**. This ensures that arrests are not made arbitrarily. 2. **Order in Writing**: If an officer in charge of a police station deputes a subordinate to make an arrest without a warrant, he must issue a written order specifying the person to be arrested and the cause of the arrest. This is set out in **CrPC section 31**. This safeguard ensures that there is a clear record of the authority to make the arrest. 3. **Prompt Production Before Court**: The person arrested must be brought before the court without unnecessary delay, as stipulated in **CrPC section 108**. This ensures that the arrested person is not detained for an unreasonable period without judicial oversight. 4. **Prohibition on Abuse of Authority**: Certain officials are prohibited from making arrests without warrants unless specific conditions are met. For instance, **CrPC sections 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, and 109** outline that certain public officers, such as assessors, witnesses, and interpreters, may not arrest without a warrant unless they are acting in accordance with their duties. These provisions prevent abuse of authority and protect the rights of individuals from unwarranted arrests. These safeguards collectively ensure that arrests without warrants are lawful, justified, and conducted in accordance with the law, while also protecting the rights of the individual.","[""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Criminal Procedure Code""]","[""31 – Procedure when police officer deputes subordinate to arrest without warrant - Procedure when police officer deputes subordinate to arrest without warrant"", ""29 – Arrest by police officer without warrant - Arrest by police officer without warrant"", ""108 – Person arrested to be brought before court without delay - Person arrested to be brought before court without delay"", ""64 – Arrest to prevent such offences - Arrest to prevent such offences"", ""394 – Expenses of assessors, witnesses, etc. - Expenses of assessors, witnesses, etc."", ""23 – PREVIOUS CONVICTION - PREVIOUS CONVICTION""]","[""When an officer in charge of a police station requires an officer subordinate to him to arrest without a warrant (otherwise than in his presence) any person who may lawfully be arrested without a warrant under section 30, he shall deliver to the officer required to make the arrest an order in writing specifying the person to be arrested and the offence or other cause for which the arrest is to be made."", ""A police officer may, without an order from a magistrate and without a warrant, arrest— (a) any person whom he suspects upon reasonable grounds of having committed a cognizable offence;

What are the procedures for dealing with taxation of employment income? for a claimant,Income Tax Act,Section 12,"The procedures for dealing with the taxation of employment income, particularly for a claimant, are governed by the **Income Tax Act, section 5**, which outlines the rules for income from employment. Under **section 5(1)** of the Income Tax Act, an amount paid to a person who is, or was at the time of the employment or when the services were rendered, a resident person in respect of any employment or services rendered in Kenya, or to a non-resident person in respect of employment with or services rendered to an employer who is resident in Kenya or the permanent establishment in Kenya of an employer who is not so resident, shall be deemed to have accrued in or to have been derived from Kenya.

Additionally, **section 5(2)** defines ""gains or profits"" to include any wages, salary, leave pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of leave, fees, commission, bonus, gratuity, or subsistence, travelling, entertainment, or other allowance received in respect of employment or services rendered. These amounts are deemed to be income in respect of the year of income in which they were earned, unless received more than four years after the year of income to which they relate. For a claimant, these provisions mean that any employment income derived from Kenya is subject to Kenyan income tax, and the claimant must report such income in their tax return. If the claimant is a non-resident, the income earned from employment in Kenya is still taxable in Kenya, and the employer is responsible for deducting and remitting the appropriate tax.

What happens when deductible expenses arises? for a public authority,Income Tax Act,Section 16,"When deductible expenses arise for a public authority, the general principle is that such expenses may be deductible for tax purposes if they are incurred in the ordinary course of the authority's business and are directly related to the generation of taxable income. However, specific rules may apply depending on the nature of the expenses and the sector in which the public authority operates. For instance, under the **Income Tax Act**, deductions for expenditures related to **mining operations** or **petroleum operations** are limited to the income derived from those operations. Similarly, under the **Value Added Tax Act**, input tax credits may be claimed against output tax if the goods or services are used exclusively for taxable supplies. If a public authority incurs a loss from mining or petroleum operations, the loss may be carried forward and deducted against future income from similar operations, subject to the provisions of the **Income Tax Act**. Additionally, if a public authority seeks to claim input tax credits or make deductions, it must ensure that the expenses meet the criteria for deductibility under the **Value Added Tax Act** and other relevant tax legislation. In cases where there is uncertainty about the deductibility of expenses, the **Tax Procedures Act** allows for the issuance of a **public ruling** to clarify the Commissioner's interpretation of the law.

What happens when licensing of manufacturers arises? for a public authority,Excise Duty Act,Section 10,"When licensing of manufacturers arises for a public authority, the following legal considerations apply: 1. **Imposition of Licensing**: Under **Constitution of Kenya, Article 210(1)**, no licensing fee may be imposed, waived, or varied except as provided by legislation. This means that any licensing of manufacturers must be governed by statutory provisions. 2. **Waiver of Licensing Fees**: If legislation permits the waiver of any licensing fee, **Constitution of Kenya, Article 210(2)(a)** requires that a public record of each waiver be maintained, and **Article 210(2)(b)** mandates that each waiver, along with the reason for it, be reported to the Auditor-General. 3. **Exclusion of State Officers**: **Constitution of Kenya, Article 210(3)** prohibits any law from excluding or authorising the exclusion of a State officer from payment of tax or licensing fees by reason of the office held or the nature of the work. This ensures that State officers are not exempt from licensing requirements solely based on their position. 4. **Public Authority and Licensing**: If the licensing of manufacturers involves a public authority, the authority must ensure compliance with the above constitutional provisions. Additionally, if the licensing involves registration or deregistration, **Tax Procedures Act, Section 81** and **Section 90** may apply, particularly regarding penalties for non-compliance and the definition of offences related to registration or licensing. In summary, the licensing of manufacturers by a public authority must be governed by legislation, with any waivers properly recorded and reported, and State officers must not be exempt from licensing fees based on their position.

What remedies are available in relation to power to distrain for rent? on appeal,Distress for Rent Act,Section 3,"The remedies available in relation to the power to distrain for rent are governed by the **Distress for Rent Act** and include the following: 1. **Distraining of Goods and Chattels**: A landlord or authorized person may distrain (seize) the tenant's goods and chattels on the premises for arrears of rent. This includes crops and stock, provided the crops are valued when they are cut, gathered, cured, and made (Section 1). 2. **Sale of Distrained Goods**: If the tenant does not pay the arrears of rent and associated costs within fourteen days of the distress, the distrained goods may be sold by a licensed auctioneer. The sale may occur on the premises or at a public auction room, depending on the tenant's request (Section 2). 3. **Double Rent for Premises Not Vacated**: If a tenant fails to vacate premises after the notice period, they must pay double rent until they leave. This double rent is subject to distraint under the same provisions as single rent (Section 13). 4. **Protection Against Irregularities**: Even if irregularities occur during the distraint process, the distress itself is not unlawful. The aggrieved party may seek compensation for special damages arising from the irregularity, provided they have not accepted amends before initiating legal action (Section 14). 5. **Court's Role in Remedies**: Under the **Land Act**, a court may consider whether to grant relief, including appointing a receiver or taking possession of land, if the remedy is necessary to prevent further loss in value. This applies particularly to agricultural land or commercial premises (Section 104). 6. **Lessee Remaining in Possession**: If a lessee remains in possession after the lease has expired, the obligations under the lease continue until the lessee leaves. Acceptance of rent for two months may create a periodic lease, but this does not constitute consent to the lessee's continued possession (Section 60). These remedies are available in the context of distraint for rent and may be subject to judicial review or appeal under the applicable legal framework.","[""Distress for Rent Act"", ""Distress for Rent Act"", ""Distress for Rent Act"", ""Distress for Rent Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act""]","[""12 – Power to distrain stock or crops on premises for arrears of rent - Power to distrain stock or crops on premises for arrears of rent"", ""4 – Distrained goods may be sold under certain circumstances - Distrained goods may be sold under certain circumstances"", ""14 – Tenant holding premises after time notified to pay double rent - Tenant holding premises after time notified to pay double rent"", ""15 – Distress for rent not unlawful for any irregularity - Distress for rent not unlawful for any irregularity"", ""104 – Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs - Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs"", ""60 – Lessee remaining in possession after termination of lease without the consent of lessor - Lessee remaining in possession after termination of lease without the consent of lessor""]","[""or a licensed auctioneer hires or otherwise procures for that purpose, and as near as may be to the premises, and thereafter he may sell the cattle and crops in the manner provided by section 4: Provided that, in the event of a valuation of the crops being made, the valuation shall be made when the crops are cut, gathered, cured and made, and not before.

How does one apply for relief concerning notice before sale? during investigations,Distress for Rent Act,Section 5,"To apply for relief concerning a notice before sale, the interested party must follow the procedures outlined in the **Land Act**. Specifically, **Section 42(1)** of the Land Act provides that a purchaser who has been served with a notice under **Section 41** may apply to the court for relief against the rescission of the contract either in the proceedings for an order for possession or in separate proceedings brought by the purchaser. Furthermore, **Section 103(4)** of the Land Act states that an application for relief by a chargor (the person who has granted a charge over land) is not to be taken as an admission that there has been a breach of a covenant by the chargor, or that the chargee has the right to exercise the remedy in respect of which the application for relief has been made. This means that the application for relief is not a confession of wrongdoing, and the court may grant relief without determining all the matters described in the section. In addition, **Section 155(3)** of the Land Act allows a person in unlawful occupation of land to apply to the court for relief against the operation of a notice or oral communication within **thirty days** of being notified of the failure to show cause. The court may then grant relief on terms and conditions it considers just and reasonable. In summary, to apply for relief concerning a notice before sale, the affected party must: 1. File an application with the court within the time limits specified in the relevant sections (e.g., 90 days under **Section 42(2)** or 30 days under **Section 155(3)**). 2. Demonstrate that the notice or action taken by the vendor or chargee is unjust or that the conditions for relief are met. 3. The court may grant relief without determining all the matters that might otherwise be relevant, as specified in **Sections 42(4)**, **103(4)**, and **155(9)**. These provisions ensure that the application for relief is not automatically an admission of fault or breach, and the court retains discretion to grant relief on just and reasonable terms.","[""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Income Tax Act"", ""Land Act""]","[""42 – Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land - Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land"", ""103 – Application for relief by chargor - Application for relief by chargor"", ""155 – Unlawful occupation of land - Unlawful occupation of land"", ""76 – Relief against forfeiture - Relief against forfeiture"", ""31 – Insurance relief - Insurance relief"", ""104 – Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs - Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs""]","[""(1) If the vendor, after serving on the purchaser a notice under section 41, applies to the court for an order for possession of the land or if the vendor has peaceably entered on to the land in order to regain possession under section 39, the purchaser may apply to the court for relief against the rescission of the contract either— (a) in the proceedings for an order for possession; or (b) in proceedings brought by the purchaser.

How does one apply for relief concerning jurisdiction of the court? during investigations,Small Claims Court Act,Section 12,"To apply for relief concerning the jurisdiction of the court during investigations, one must first determine whether the matter falls within the jurisdiction of the court in question. Under the **Small Claims Court Act**, the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court is limited to civil claims of a certain nature and value, as outlined in **Section 12(1)** of the Act. Specifically, the Court has jurisdiction over claims relating to contracts, liability in tort, compensation for personal injuries, and other matters as defined. If a party believes that the court lacks jurisdiction, they may raise this issue at the outset of the proceedings. If the court's jurisdiction is challenged, the court may determine whether the claim falls within its jurisdiction under **Section 12** of the **Small Claims Court Act**. If the claim is found to be outside the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, the court may transfer the matter to the appropriate court, such as the **High Court**, which has broader jurisdiction under **Article 165** of the **Constitution of Kenya**. In cases where the jurisdiction of the court is disputed during investigations, the court may also consider **Article 22** of the **Constitution**, which empowers the High Court to hear applications for redress of a denial, violation, or infringement of rights under the **Bill of Rights**. If the jurisdictional issue is tied to a constitutional right, the court may grant appropriate relief, including a **declaration of rights** or **injunction**, as outlined in **Section 4(3)** of the **Small Claims Court Act**. In summary, to apply for relief concerning the jurisdiction of the court during investigations, the party must first establish whether the claim falls within the jurisdiction of the court. If not, the court may transfer the matter or grant relief under constitutional provisions.

How is privacy handled under the law? in practice,Constitution of Kenya,Article 31,"Privacy is protected under Kenyan law through a combination of constitutional provisions, specific statutes, and regulatory oversight.

Additionally, the **Office of the Data Commissioner** is empowered to **inspect entities**, **promote compliance**, and **collaborate with national security organs** to ensure data protection standards are upheld (Section 8). In the context of **children in conflict with the law**, the **Children Act** mandates that detention be a **last resort**, and that children deprived of liberty are treated humanely, with **respect for privacy, legal capacity, and dignity** (Section 26(6)). Parents or legal guardians also retain the **right to reasonable supervision** of their children’s conduct (Section 27(2)).

Additionally, the Criminal Procedure Code provides general procedural guidelines for hearings, such as the requirement for the complainant to appear and the court's discretion to adjourn or proceed with the case if the complainant does not appear (Article 202).

What are the procedures for dealing with termination notice? for a claimant,Employment Act,Section 35,"The procedures for dealing with a termination notice, in the context of a claim, are governed by the **Employment Act** and the **Small Claims Court Act**. Here is a concise legal summary: 1. **Notice of Termination**: Under **Employment Act, section 35(1)**, an employer must provide a written notice of termination. If the notice period in the employment contract exceeds the statutory minimum, the longer period applies. If the employee does not understand the notice, the employer must explain it orally in a language the employee understands (**Employment Act, section 35(3)**). 2. **Proof of Reason for Termination**: In any claim arising from termination, the employer must prove the reason or reasons for termination. If the employer fails to do so, the termination is deemed **unfair** (**Employment Act, section 43(1)**). The reasons for termination are defined as the genuine beliefs of the employer at the time of termination (**Employment Act, section 43(2)**). 3. **Unfair Termination**: A termination is considered unfair if it is not just and equitable, taking into account factors such as the employer's procedure, the employee's conduct, compliance with statutory requirements, and previous employer practices (**Employment Act, section 45(5)**). 4. **Remedies for Wrongful Dismissal**: If a termination is found to be unfair or wrongful, the **Employment and Labour Relations Court** may recommend remedies such as reinstatement, re-engagement, compensation, or other appropriate relief, considering factors like the employee's length of service, the reason for termination, and the employee's ability to secure comparable employment (**Employment Act, section 49(1)**). 5. **Small Claims Court Procedures**: If the claimant seeks remedies through the **Small Claims Court**, and the respondent fails to respond or appear, the court may enter a **default judgment** in favour of the claimant (**Small Claims Court Act, section 27(1)**). The court may also grant an order against the respondent if it is satisfied the claimant is entitled to it (**Small Claims Court Act, section 27(3)**). These procedures ensure that employees have the right to challenge unfair termination and seek appropriate remedies, while employers must provide clear notice and justify their reasons for termination.","[""Employment Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Small Claims Court Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Employment Act""]","[""35 – Termination notice - Termination notice"", ""43 – Proof of reason for termination - Proof of reason for termination"", ""45 – Unfair termination - Unfair termination"", ""27 – Default judgment - Default judgment"", ""49 – Remedies for wrongful dismissal and unfair termination - Remedies for wrongful dismissal and unfair termination"", ""42 – Termination of probationary contracts - Termination of probationary contracts""]","[""apply in the case of a contract of service whose terms provide for the giving of a period of notice of termination in writing greater than the period required by the provision of this subsection which would otherwise be applicable thereto.

This includes continuous service entitlements, such as wages, allowances, and benefits, from the date of employment as a casual employee. Additionally, **Section 37(4)** of the Employment Act empowers the **Employment and Labour Relations Court** to vary the terms of service of a casual employee and may declare the employee to be employed on terms and conditions consistent with the Act. If the casual employee is aggrieved by the treatment of their employer, they may file a complaint with the **Labour Officer**, and **Section 86** of the Employment Act shall apply, which outlines the procedures for handling such complaints.

The notice must specify the date, time, and place of allocation, as well as the appraised value of the land and the terms of allocation.

This means that all charges, whether formal or informal, are subject to the provisions of Part 7. - **Section 60(2)** clarifies that **informal charges** (created under Section 79) are also covered by this Part, and they are subject to the rules on registration and priority. 2. **Registration and Validity of Charges**: - **Section 79(5)** of the Land Act states that a **formal charge** only takes effect when it is **registered in the land register**.

Who is entitled to relief concerning remedies of chargee? for an employer,Land Act,Section 80,"The question appears to conflate two distinct areas of law: remedies of a chargee under the Land Act and remedies for wrongful dismissal under the Employment Act.

The court may grant relief without determining whether there has been a breach of a covenant by the chargor, or whether the chargee has properly served all required notices. As for **remedies for wrongful dismissal**, **Employment Act, section 49** outlines the factors the court may consider when recommending remedies, including the wishes of the employee, the circumstances of the termination, the practicability of reinstatement, and other relevant considerations. Since the question combines these two areas and appears to be based on a misunderstanding or confusion, it is important to clarify that **relief concerning remedies of a chargee** is governed by the **Land Act**, while **remedies for wrongful dismissal** are governed by the **Employment Act**.

However, the validity of the oral will is limited to the extent it is proved by a competent independent witness (Law of Succession Act - 10). 3. **Documents related to admissions**: If oral admissions are being relied upon, the party proposing the admissions must first establish their entitlement to secondary evidence of the contents of the document. This may involve producing the original document or other supporting documentation (Evidence Act - 22). 4. **Documents related to the subject matter of the oral evidence**: Any document that provides context for the facts in question, such as contracts, agreements, or other legal instruments, may be necessary to support the oral evidence (Evidence Act - 62, 63). 5. **Documents that establish the authenticity or genuineness of the oral evidence**: If the genuineness of a document is in question, the court may require the production of the document itself or other evidence to support the oral testimony (Evidence Act - 22).

This allows flexibility in admitting documentary evidence even if the original document is not produced, provided a certified copy is produced instead. 2. **Certification of Copies**: If a copy of the original document is produced in lieu of the original, it must be certified as a true copy in a manner approved by the court. This certification is a procedural requirement to ensure the authenticity of the documentary evidence. 3. **Court's Discretion in Admissibility**: **Evidence Act, Section 144(2)** allows the court to admit evidence of a fact if it is satisfied that the fact, if proved, would be admissible. This discretion enables the court to assess the relevance and admissibility of documentary evidence at the hearing stage. 4. **No Specific Time Limit**: There is no specific time limit mentioned in the context for the admissibility of documentary evidence at the hearing stage. The court's discretion and the procedural requirements under Sections 35 and 144 govern the timeline for admitting such evidence.

The admissibility of secondary evidence is governed by sections 66 and 68 of the Evidence Act (12–13). 2. **Notice to Produce a Document**: Before secondary evidence can be given, the party proposing to use it must provide notice to the adverse party or their advocate to produce the original document, unless exempted under section 69(1) of the Evidence Act (14). Exemptions include when the document itself is a notice, when the adverse party must know it is required to produce it, or when the adverse party has obtained possession of the original by fraud or force. 3. **Examination of Formal Matters**: If a witness states that a contract or disposition of property was contained in a document, the adverse party may object to the evidence until the document is produced or secondary evidence is established under section 152 of the Evidence Act (15). 4. **Power to Take Further Evidence**: On appeal, the High Court may take further evidence if it deems it necessary. This evidence may be taken by the High Court itself or by a subordinate court, which shall certify the evidence to the High Court. The evidence is treated as if it were taken at a trial before a subordinate court under section 358 of the Criminal Procedure Code (16). These remedies ensure that secondary evidence is admissible and properly managed during appeals, subject to the procedural requirements and exceptions set out in the relevant legal provisions.","[""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act""]","[""66 – Secondary evidence. - Secondary evidence."", ""68 – Proof of documents by secondary evidence. - Proof of documents by secondary evidence."", ""69 – Notice to produce a document. - Notice to produce a document."", ""358 – Power to take further evidence - Power to take further evidence"", ""152 – Examination as to whether certain formal matters are contained in writing. - Examination as to whether certain formal matters are contained in writing."", ""97 – Written contracts and grants. - Written contracts and grants.""]","[""Secondary evidence includes— (a) certified copies given under the provisions hereinafter contained; (b) copies made from the original by mechanical processes which in themselves ensure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies; (c) copies made from or compared with the original; (d) counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute them; (e) oral accounts of the contents of a document given by some person who has himself seen it."", ""offering evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in a reasonable time; (d) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable; (e) when the original is a public document within the meaning of section 79 of this Act; (f) when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by this Act or by any written law to be given in evidence; (g) when the original consists of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in court, and the fact to be proved is the general result of the whole collection.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to presumptions of fact? at registration,Evidence Act,Section 119,"The safeguards to protect rights relating to presumptions of fact at registration are governed by the **Evidence Act**. Specifically: - **Section 4(1)** of the Evidence Act provides that whenever it is provided by law that the court may presume a fact, it may either regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved, or may call for proof of it. This ensures that presumptions of fact are not automatically accepted without scrutiny, and that the burden of proof remains with the party seeking to disprove the presumption. - **Section 4(2)** further clarifies that whenever it is directed by law that the court shall presume a fact, it shall regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved. This reinforces the legal obligation of the court to treat the presumption as established unless evidence to the contrary is presented. - **Section 4(3)** states that when one fact is declared by law to be conclusive proof of another, the court shall, on proof of the one fact, regard the other as proved, and shall not allow evidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it. This ensures that once a fact is established as conclusive, it cannot be challenged, thereby protecting the rights of the parties involved in the legal process. These provisions collectively ensure that presumptions of fact are treated with due legal safeguards, preventing unjust conclusions and ensuring that the burden of proof remains with the party challenging the presumption.","[""Evidence Act"", ""Data Protection Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Persons with Disabilities Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Land Act""]","[""4 – Presumptions of fact. - Presumptions of fact."", ""49 – Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya - Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya"", ""107 – Burden of proof. - Burden of proof."", ""62 – Discrimination contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution - Discrimination contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution"", ""3 – Interpretation. - Interpretation."", ""19 – Conservation of land based natural resources - Conservation of land based natural resources""]","[""(1) Whenever it is provided by law that the court may presume a fact, it may either regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved, or may call for proof of it.

How is privileged communications handled under the law? in practice,Evidence Act,Section 125,"Privileged communications are protected under Kenyan law, particularly under the **Evidence Act (Cap. 33 of 2013)**.

In that case, he may be compelled to disclose such communications as may appear necessary to explain any evidence he has given (Evidence Act, **Section 137**). 3. **Communications During Marriage**: No person is compelled to disclose any communication made to him or her during marriage by the other spouse, nor may a person disclose such communication without the consent of the person who made it, unless it is in a suit between the parties or in specific exceptions outlined in the Evidence Act (Evidence Act, **Section 130**). 4. **Privileged Document in Possession of Another**: No one is compelled to produce documents in his possession that another person would be entitled to refuse to produce, unless the other person consents to their production (Evidence Act, **Section 139**).

This ensures that the terms of the contract are not subject to oral testimony. 4. **Public Authorities and Oral Agreements**: While public authorities may be exempt from the written contract requirement for certain types of contracts (e.g., those made in the course of public action), any oral agreement that forms part of a contract for the disposition of land must be **reduced to writing** within **two years** of the **Land Act's commencement**, as per **Land Act, s. 55(2)(c)(i)**.

What remedies are available in relation to illegal contracts? on appeal,Law of Contract Act,Section 10,"In relation to illegal contracts, the remedies available are governed by the **Employment Act** and other relevant legal provisions. Under **Employment Act, section 49**, the remedies for wrongful dismissal and unfair termination include reinstatement, re-engagement, compensation, and other forms of redress. These remedies are determined based on various factors, including the wishes of the employee, the circumstances of the termination, the practicability of reinstatement, the common law principle against specific performance in service contracts, the employee's length of service, and other relevant considerations. If an appeal is made to the **Court of Appeal** under **Tax Procedures Act, section 54**, the appeal shall be on a **question of law only**, and the burden of proof lies with the taxpayer to show that a tax decision is incorrect. However, this provision is specific to tax-related appeals and does not directly apply to employment contracts. In cases involving **written contracts**, the **Evidence Act, section 97** provides that the terms of a contract must be proved by the document itself or secondary evidence. This ensures that the content of the contract is not subject to dispute once it is properly documented. If the contract was made **abroad**, **Employment Act, section 88(3)** requires that the contract be attested by a judge or magistrate and authenticated by the official seal of the court to which the judge or magistrate is attached. This ensures that the contract is recognized under Kenyan law. In summary, the remedies available for illegal contracts depend on the nature of the breach, the legality of the contract, and the applicable legal provisions. If the contract is illegal, the remedies may be limited, and the court may not enforce it. However, if the contract is lawful but was breached, the remedies outlined in **Employment Act, section 49** may apply. If an appeal is made, it shall be on a **question of law only**, as per **Tax Procedures Act, section 54**.","[""Employment Act"", ""Tax Procedures Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Tax Procedures Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Criminal Procedure Code""]","[""88 – Saving of contracts of service made abroad - Saving of contracts of service made abroad"", ""54 – Appeals to Court of Appeal - Appeals to Court of Appeal"", ""49 – Remedies for wrongful dismissal and unfair termination - Remedies for wrongful dismissal and unfair termination"", ""56 – General provisions relating to objections and appeals - General provisions relating to objections and appeals"", ""97 – Written contracts and grants. - Written contracts and grants."", ""379 – Appeals from High Court to Court of Appeal - Appeals from High Court to Court of Appeal""]","[""(1) Nothing in this Act shall prevent an employer or employee from enforcing their respective rights and remedies for any breach or non-performance of a lawful contract of service made outside Kenya, but the respective rights of the parties under that contract as well against each other as against third parties invading those rights may be enforced in the same manner as other contracts.

How does one apply for relief concerning separation? during investigations,Marriage Act,Section 64,"The process for applying for relief concerning separation is governed by the **Marriage Act**. Under **Section 66(1)** of the Marriage Act, a party to a marriage celebrated under Part IV may not petition the court for the separation of the parties or for the dissolution of the marriage unless **three years** have elapsed since the celebration of the marriage. If the conditions for filing a petition are met, the petitioner may file the petition with the court for the separation of the parties or the dissolution of the marriage, even if there have been efforts to reconcile the parties. Furthermore, **Section 66(4)** of the Marriage Act allows the court to refer a matrimonial dispute to a conciliatory process agreed between the parties. If the court grants the petition for separation or dissolution of the marriage, it may also make orders regarding **maintenance** for the children, as provided under **Section 112** of the **Children Act**, which allows the court to make maintenance orders during matrimonial proceedings. It is important to note that **Section 66(5)** of the Marriage Act permits the proceedings for the dissolution of a marriage to be adjourned for a period not exceeding six months for further inquiries or attempts at reconciliation. In summary, relief concerning separation may be sought by filing a petition with the court under **Section 66(1)** of the **Marriage Act**, provided the three-year period has elapsed and the necessary grounds for separation have been established.","[""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Income Tax Act"", ""Marriage Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Land Act""]","[""103 – Application for relief by chargor - Application for relief by chargor"", ""42 – Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land - Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land"", ""31 – Insurance relief - Insurance relief"", ""66 – Right to petition for separation or divorce - Right to petition for separation or divorce"", ""112 – Maintenance during matrimonial proceedings. - Maintenance during matrimonial proceedings."", ""76 – Relief against forfeiture - Relief against forfeiture""]","[""(1) An application for relief against the exercise by the chargee of any of the remedies referred to in section 90(3) may be made by— (a) the chargor; (b) if two or more persons are joint chargors, by one or more of them on their own behalf; (c) a spouse of the chargor to the extent that the spouse was required to give consent to the creation of the charge but did not give consent; or (d) deleted by Act No. 28 of 2016, s. 75; (e) if the chargor has been adjudged bankrupt, the bankruptcy trustee of the estate of the charger.

What safeguards exist to protect rights relating to divorce in civil marriages? at registration,Marriage Act,Section 66,"There are specific safeguards to protect rights relating to divorce in civil marriages at registration, as outlined in the **Marriage Act** and the **Constitution of Kenya**. Firstly, under **Section 51** of the **Marriage Act**, the Registrar may appoint a member of the diplomatic staff of Kenya in a foreign country to celebrate civil marriages, ensuring that marriages celebrated abroad are registered in accordance with Kenyan law. This guarantees that marriages, including those involving divorce, are recognized and protected under Kenyan law. Additionally, **Section 5** of the **Marriage Act** provides that all marriages registered under this Act have the same legal status, ensuring that rights and obligations of the parties are protected regardless of the nature of the marriage. Furthermore, **Section 42** of the **Marriage Act** mandates that any person who celebrates or officiates at a marriage must deliver a copy of the marriage certificate to the Registrar. This duty ensures that all marriages, including those that may lead to divorce, are properly recorded and protected under the law. Moreover, the **Constitution of Kenya** provides broader protections. **Article 43(1)** guarantees the right to economic and social rights, which includes the right to access legal redress and protection from arbitrary detention, which is relevant in cases involving divorce. **Article 49(1)** also protects the rights of arrested persons, which may apply in cases where individuals are involved in legal disputes over divorce. In addition, **Article 27** of the Constitution, in conjunction with the **Persons with Disabilities Act**, ensures that individuals with disabilities are not discriminated against in matters relating to marriage and divorce, including access to legal services and registration processes. These provisions collectively ensure that rights relating to divorce in civil marriages are safeguarded through legal registration, equal treatment, and constitutional protections.","[""Marriage Act"", ""Persons with Disabilities Act"", ""Marriage Act"", ""Constitution of Kenya"", ""Marriage Act"", ""Marriage Act""]","[""96 – Transitional Provisions - Transitional Provisions"", ""62 – Discrimination contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution - Discrimination contrary to Article 27 of the Constitution"", ""51 – Appointment of marriage officers in foreign countries - Appointment of marriage officers in foreign countries"", ""24 – Limitation of rights and fundamental freedoms - Limitation of rights and fundamental freedoms"", ""3 – Meaning of marriage - Meaning of marriage"", ""42 – Duty to register marriages - Duty to register marriages""]","[""(1) A person who, immediately before the date of commencement of this Act, was a Registrar of Marriages under the Marriage Act (Repealed) or the African Christian Marriage and Divorce Act (Repealed), or an assistant Registrar under the Islamic Marriage and Divorce Registration Act (Repealed), shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, send all registers of marriages and divorces to the Registrar.

How is maintenance orders handled under the law? in practice,Marriage Act,Section 70,"Maintenance orders under Kenyan law are handled with a focus on the child's best interests and the enforcement of financial support. Courts have the authority to make interim maintenance orders ex parte, allowing for the dispensation of notice if it is in the child's best interests (Children Act, s 117(1)). These interim orders remain in force until the court hears the parties involved in a full hearing (Children Act, s 117(2)). During matrimonial proceedings, courts may also issue maintenance orders, even if proceedings for nullity, judicial separation, or divorce are ongoing (Children Act, s 112). Once maintenance proceedings have commenced, further actions under other Acts require the court's leave (Children Act, s 112). If a maintenance order is issued, the court may direct that maintenance monies be paid to a person other than the applicant, particularly if the original recipient is not fit, has left the jurisdiction, or has mismanaged funds (Children Act, s 115). In cases of non-compliance, the court may enforce orders by restraining the disposal of the respondent's property, directing the resale of such property, or issuing injunctions to prevent the wastage or damage of property (Children Act, s 121(4)(f)). In the Small Claims Court, maintenance orders may be made for the payment of money in lump sum or instalments, and the court may issue consequential orders for enforcement (Small Claims Court Act, s 36(1)). Maintenance orders for a spouse may lapse upon the death of the spouse or if the person being maintained becomes self-supporting, unless the order specifies a shorter duration or has been revoked (Marriage Act, s 78).","[""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Small Claims Court Act"", ""Marriage Act""]","[""117 – Interim orders of maintenance - Interim orders of maintenance"", ""121 – Enforcement of orders for maintenance or contribution - Enforcement of orders for maintenance or contribution"", ""115 – Power to order maintenance monies to be paid to person other than the applicant - Power to order maintenance monies to be paid to person other than the applicant"", ""112 – Maintenance during matrimonial proceedings. - Maintenance during matrimonial proceedings."", ""36 – Orders of the Court - Orders of the Court"", ""78 – Lapsing of maintenance - Lapsing of maintenance""]","[""(1) A Court may make an interim maintenance order, on the ex–parte application of any person and in so doing, may dispense with any notice required to be given to any person, if the Court is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child to do so.

This process may involve additional hearings and inquiries into the child's wellbeing and the parent's efforts to locate the child (Children Act, Section 190(1)-(3)). In summary, while the context does not specify exact timelines, the adoption process involves several procedural steps that must be completed before the Court can make an adoption order. These include pre-hearing requirements, the hearing itself, and any subsequent review or reconsideration of the adoption order. The Court must ensure that all legal and welfare considerations are addressed at each stage.","[""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act""]","[""194 – Powers of the Court in adoption proceedings - Powers of the Court in adoption proceedings"", ""17 – Adoption - Adoption"", ""190 – Review of adoption - Review of adoption"", ""147 – Mode of dealing with witness arrested under warrant - Mode of dealing with witness arrested under warrant"", ""184 – Pre-requisites for Adoption - Pre-requisites for Adoption"", ""186 – Who may apply to adopt a child - Who may apply to adopt a child""]","[""(1) Before making an adoption order, the Court shall inquire into and be satisfied on evidence before it that— (a) every person whose consent is required under this Part, which consent has not been dispensed with, has consented to and understands the nature and effect of the adoption order for which the application is made; (b) in the case of a parent, the parent understands that the effect of the adoption order is to permanently deprive him or her of his or her parental rights; (c) if made, the order will be in the best interests of the child, having regard to the wishes of the child, depending on the child’s age and understanding, and to the ability of the applicant to maintain and educate the child; (d) the applicant has not received or agreed to receive, and that no person had made or given or agreed to make or give to the applicant, any payment or other reward in consideration of the adoption; (e) any person whose consent is dispensed with on the grounds of incapacity is still incapable of giving consent at the date of making the order; (f) where the applicant is not a relative of the child, reasonable steps have been taken to inform the relatives of the child of the proposed adoption, and no relative"", ""The terms of the Moratorium on inter-country and resident adoptions issued on 26th November 2014 shall apply to matters relating to inter-country adoption under this Act.

What remedies are available in relation to children who may be adopted? on appeal,Children Act,Section 185,"The remedies available in relation to children who may be adopted, particularly in the context of appeals, are outlined in the Children Act. Specifically, **section 194(3)** of the Children Act provides that **no appeal shall lie against an order of remission made under section 194**, but **nothing in this section shall affect any right of appeal against the verdict or finding on which such order under section 194 of this Act, he may appeal against such findings to the Court of Appeal**. This means that while an adoption order itself may not be subject to appeal under section 194(3), any findings or verdicts that led to the adoption order may still be subject to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Additionally, **section 199(3)** of the Children Act provides that **where an adoption order is quashed or an appeal against an adoption order is allowed, the Court making the order to quash shall direct the Registrar to cancel any entry in the Register of Births together with any entry in the Adopted Children Register**. This highlights the availability of judicial review and the possibility of quashing an adoption order if it is found to be invalid or if an appeal is successful. In summary, while direct appeals against adoption orders are not permitted under section 194(3), appeals against the findings or verdicts that led to the adoption order may be brought before the Court of Appeal. Additionally, adoption orders may be quashed if they are found to be invalid.","[""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Children Act""]","[""185 – Children who may be adopted - Children who may be adopted"", ""200 – Adopted Children Register - Adopted Children Register"", ""199 – Variation of orders - Variation of orders"", ""205 – Intestacies and testamentary instruments - Intestacies and testamentary instruments"", ""219 – Power to remit cases to Children’s Court - Power to remit cases to Children’s Court"", ""42 – Functions of the Council - Functions of the Council""]","[""(1) Any child who is resident within Kenya may be adopted whether or not the child is a Kenyan citizen, or was born in Kenya.

How does one apply for relief concerning arrest without warrant? during investigations,Criminal Procedure Code,Section 29,"The question appears to conflate two distinct legal areas: arrest without warrant and applications for relief under the Land Act. There is no provision in the provided context that directly addresses how to apply for relief concerning arrest without warrant during investigations.

Importantly, an application for relief is **not taken as an admission** that there has been a breach of a covenant, or that the chargee has the right to exercise the remedy, or that all notices were properly served, or that the period for remedying the breach was reasonable or had expired. If the question is about **arrest without warrant**, the legal framework is governed by the **Criminal Procedure Code**, particularly sections 29 and 31, which outline the conditions under which a police officer may arrest without a warrant and the procedures for such arrests.

The amount of bail shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case and shall not be excessive (Criminal Procedure Code, s. 123). 2. **Bail Bond**: Before a person is released on bail or on his own recognizance, a bond for such sum as the court or police officer thinks sufficient shall be executed by that person, and, when he is released on bail, by one or more sufficient sureties. The bond is conditioned that the person shall attend at the time and place mentioned in the bond and shall continue so to attend until otherwise directed by the court or police officer (Criminal Procedure Code, s. 124). 3. **Discharge of Sureties**: All or any of the sureties for the appearance and attendance of a person released on bail may apply to a magistrate to discharge the bond either wholly or so far as it relates to the applicant or applicants. On the appearance of the person pursuant to the warrant issued or on his voluntary surrender, the magistrate shall direct the bond to be discharged either wholly or so far as it relates to the applicant or applicants (Criminal Procedure Code, s. 128). 4. **Right to Challenge Bail Conditions**: The High Court may, in any case, direct that an accused person be admitted to bail or that bail required by a subordinate court or police officer be reduced, ensuring that the bail conditions are not excessive or unjust (Criminal Procedure Code, s. 123).

What does the law provide regarding institution of proceedings?,Criminal Procedure Code,Section 89,"The law provides the following regarding the institution of proceedings: 1. **Proceedings against the Council**: Any proceedings against the Council are deemed to be proceedings against the national government and are subject to the **Government Proceedings Act (Cap. 40)** and the **Public Authorities Limitations Act (Cap. 39)**. Any notice or processes in respect of such legal proceedings shall be served upon the **Chief Executive Officer** (Children Act, s. 51(1) and (2)). 2. **Enforcement of the Bill of Rights**: The court shall facilitate the enforcement of the Bill of Rights by keeping formalities to a minimum, entertaining proceedings on the basis of informal documentation if necessary, and not charging any fee for commencing proceedings. Additionally, the court shall not be unreasonably restricted by procedural technicalities, and an expert may appear as a **friend of the court** with the court's leave (Constitution, s. 22(3)). 3. **Protection from legal proceedings**: Criminal proceedings against the President or a person performing the functions of that office during their tenure of office are prohibited. Similarly, civil proceedings in respect of actions taken in the exercise of their powers are also prohibited. However, this immunity does not extend to crimes under international treaties to which Kenya is a party (Constitution, s. 143). 4. **Procedure when accused does not understand proceedings**: If the accused does not understand the proceedings, the court may acquit the accused if the evidence does not justify a conviction. If the court believes the evidence does justify a conviction, the accused may be ordered to be detained during the President’s pleasure, subject to confirmation by the High Court (Criminal Procedure Code, s. 167). 5. **Placement of children in a charitable children’s institution**: A Charitable Children’s Institution may admit a child only if the child is referred by an interim or care order, or taken by an authorised officer who has reasonable cause to believe the child is in need of care and protection.

How is pleas handled under the law? in practice,Criminal Procedure Code,Section 137,"Under Kenyan law, pleas are handled in accordance with the **Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 12 of 1967, 1st Sch.)**, specifically **Section 279**.

Additionally, the accused may plead that they have obtained the **President’s pardon** for the offence. If either of these pleas is made, the court is required to **try whether the plea is true or not**. If the court determines that the plea is **not true** or **false**, the accused must proceed to plead to the information. This process ensures that the court assesses the validity of the plea before determining the appropriate course of action in the trial.

Who is entitled to relief concerning judgment? for an employer,Criminal Procedure Code,Section 169,"The question appears to conflate two distinct legal concepts: relief concerning judgment and relief for an employer. Based on the context provided: 1. **Relief concerning judgment** is governed by the **Small Claims Court Act, section 27(1)**, which allows the court to enter a default judgment if the respondent fails to respond to the claim. This provision does not directly relate to employers. 2. **Relief for an employer** is addressed in the **Persons with Disabilities Act, section 23(1)**, which entitles a private employer who employs a person with a disability to a deduction from taxable income equivalent to **25% of the salary paid** to the employee. This relief is subject to the condition that the employer provides proof of the employee's disability and accreditation from the Council. In summary, an employer may be entitled to **tax relief** under the **Persons with Disabilities Act, section 23(1)**, but there is no provision in the context that directly addresses **relief concerning judgment** for an employer.

How is rates of income tax handled under the law? in practice,Income Tax Act,Section 5,"Under Kenyan law, the rates of income tax are determined by the **Income Tax Act (Cap. 470)**, specifically **Section 34**, which outlines the tax rates applicable to income. The tax chargeable on any income is at the rate specified in the **Third Schedule** of the Act. This schedule sets out the applicable tax rates for different types of income and taxpayers, including residents and non-residents. For **non-residents**, the tax rates are specified in **paragraph 1 of the Third Schedule**, and these rates apply from **18th June, 1971**, as noted in the transitional provisions of **Section 133** of the Income Tax Act. These rates are also subject to any amendments made under **Section 4 of the Value Added Tax Act**, which allows the Cabinet Secretary to adjust tax rates, including income tax, by up to **25%** of the rate specified in the relevant schedule. In **practice**, the rates of income tax are applied based on the taxpayer's residency status and the nature of their income. The **tax rate is calculated on the taxable income**, which is determined after allowing for deductions and reliefs. Additionally, **foreign tax credits** may be allowed under **Section 42** of the Income Tax Act, provided they meet the conditions outlined in that section. In summary, the rates of income tax are determined by the **Third Schedule** of the **Income Tax Act**, with specific provisions for **non-residents** and **transitional arrangements**.

This means that failure to file returns or maintain proper records may also be considered an offence, with penalties as prescribed under the regulations. 3. **Regulatory Framework**: The **Value Added Tax Act, section 67** allows the Cabinet Secretary to make regulations prescribing conditions and procedures for the registration of registered persons, including the submission of returns and the place at which returns are to be submitted. These regulations are subject to approval by the National Assembly, ensuring transparency and accountability in the tax administration process. 4. **Cancellation of Registration**: Under the **Value Added Tax Act, section 66**, the Commissioner may cancel a person’s registration if they have not kept proper tax records, furnished regular and reliable returns, or complied with obligations under other revenue laws.

How does one apply for relief concerning tenant’s remedies? during investigations,Distress for Rent Act,Section 10,"To apply for relief concerning tenant’s remedies, one must follow the procedures outlined in the **Land Act** and other relevant legislation. Relief can be sought by the tenant or other interested parties, such as sublessees or chargees, against the enforcement of a lease forfeiture or other remedies. Under **Land Act, section 76(1)**, a lessee who has received a notice of forfeiture may apply to the court for relief. The court may grant or refuse relief based on the circumstances, including the conduct of the parties and the nature of the case. If the court grants relief, it may do so on such terms as it considers appropriate. Additionally, **Land Act, section 103(1)** allows the chargor (or lessee, in this context) to apply for relief against the exercise of remedies by the chargee, such as repossession or sale of the land. The application may be made by the chargor, a joint chargor, a spouse, or the bankruptcy trustee, depending on the situation. **Land Act, section 104(1)** further provides that the court must consider whether the proposed remedy is reasonably necessary to prevent further reduction in the value of the land or to reverse any reduction, particularly in cases involving agricultural land or commercial premises. If the tenant is seeking relief against the enforcement of a lease forfeiture, they may also refer to **Land Act, section 76(2)**, which allows the court to vest the property in a sublessee or chargee, subject to certain conditions. In all cases, the application for relief must be made promptly, and the court has discretion to grant relief on terms it deems appropriate.

The agreement must set out terms and conditions of service for all unionisable employees covered by the recognition agreement (Section 57(1)). 2. **Disclosure**: Employers must disclose all relevant information to the trade union to enable effective negotiations. This information is confidential and may not be disclosed to third parties unless necessary for negotiations (Section 57(2)-(4)). 3. **Binding Effect**: A collective agreement binds the parties to the agreement, all unionisable employees employed by the employer or members of the employers’ organisation party to the agreement, and employers who become members of an employers’ organisation party to the agreement. The agreement continues to bind employees who have resigned from the trade union and employers who are or become members of the employers’ organisation (Section 59(1)(2)). 4. **Registration**: Every collective agreement must be submitted to the Employment and Labour Relations Court for registration within fourteen days of its conclusion. The agreement may be registered in its original form or with amendments agreed upon by the parties. The Court may refuse registration if the agreement conflicts with the Act or other laws, or does not comply with directives on wages and conditions of employment (Section 60(1)-(6)). 5. **Enforceability**: Once registered, the collective agreement becomes enforceable and effective from the date of registration. It is incorporated into the contract of employment of every employee covered by the agreement (Section 59(3)). 6. **Dispute Resolution**: Collective agreements may include provisions for alternative dispute resolution, such as conciliation and arbitration. Awards from arbitration are final and binding, subject to review by the Employment and Labour Relations Court within thirty days (Section 58(1)-(4)). 7. **Public Sector**: In the public sector, where there is no collective bargaining, the Cabinet Secretary may establish machinery to determine terms and conditions of employment.

How is enforcement of decree handled under the law? in practice,Small Claims Court Act,Section 38,"Enforcement of a decree in Kenya is governed by several legal provisions, depending on the nature of the decree and the court that issued it. Under the **Marriage Act**, a decree of annulment, divorce, or separation issued by a foreign court may be recognized in Kenya if certain conditions are met, such as the domicile or residence of the parties in Kenya or the effectiveness of the decree in the country of domicile (Section 67). If the decree is recognized, it may be enforced in Kenya as if it were a decree of a Kenyan court. For **domestic decrees**, enforcement is generally governed by the **Small Claims Court Act**, which outlines procedures for enforcing orders to pay money. If a party fails to comply with an order, enforcement may be carried out through processes such as writs or other legal remedies, provided the necessary procedural requirements are met (Section 37). In addition, the **Children Act** provides for the enforcement of rights concerning children, allowing courts to issue orders, writs, or directions to secure the enforcement of provisions related to child welfare (Section 29). For **data-related decrees**, the **Data Protection Act** allows the Data Commissioner to issue enforcement notices to ensure compliance with data protection laws. Non-compliance with such notices may result in criminal liability (Section 58). In practice, enforcement of a decree depends on the specific legal framework and the type of decree. If the decree is recognized under Kenyan law, it may be enforced through the appropriate court or administrative body, following the procedures outlined in the relevant statutes.","[""Children Act"", ""Marriage Act"", ""Small Claims Court Act"", ""Data Protection Act"", ""Marriage Act"", ""Marriage Act""]","[""29 – Enforcement of rights under this Part - Enforcement of rights under this Part"", ""67 – Recognition of decree by foreign court in matrimonial proceedings - Recognition of decree by foreign court in matrimonial proceedings"", ""37 – Enforcement of orders to pay money - Enforcement of orders to pay money"", ""58 – Enforcement notices - Enforcement notices"", ""72 – Registration of divorce under Islamic law - Registration of divorce under Islamic law"", ""61 – Registration of foreign annulments and divorces - Registration of foreign annulments and divorces""]","[""determine an application under subsection (1), and may make such orders, issue such writs and give such directions as it may consider appropriate for the purpose of enforcing or securing the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Part.

What are the requirements for compliance with discrimination? for a private party,Persons with Disabilities Act,Section 26,"The requirements for compliance with discrimination for a private party in Kenya are outlined in the **Children Act, section 9(1)**, which prohibits discrimination against children on various grounds, including **disability**. While the Children Act specifically addresses discrimination against children, the broader principle of non-discrimination is also reflected in other laws, such as the **Persons with Disabilities Act** and the **Constitution of Kenya, 2010**. ### Key Legal Requirements for Compliance with Discrimination: 1. **Non-Discrimination Principle**: Under **section 9(1) of the Children Act**, no person shall discriminate against a child on the grounds of **disability**, among other factors. This implies that private parties, including employers, must ensure that their policies, practices, and services do not discriminate against individuals with disabilities. 2. **Reasonable Accommodation**: Under **section 23(2) of the Persons with Disabilities Act**, private employers who make **improvements or modifications** to their physical facilities or provide **special services** to accommodate employees with disabilities are entitled to **additional tax deductions**. This encourages compliance with the principle of **reasonable accommodation**, which is a key component of non-discrimination. 3. **Accreditation and Proof**: Private employers who wish to claim deductions under **section 23(1)** of the Persons with Disabilities Act must **present proof** certified by the **Council** that the employee is a person with a disability and has been accredited with the Council. This ensures that **only eligible individuals** benefit from such incentives, promoting compliance with anti-discrimination laws. 4. **Compliance with Constitutional and Legal Standards**: The **Constitution of Kenya, 2010**, **section 6**, guarantees the **right to equality** and **non-discrimination**. Private parties must ensure that their actions align with these constitutional principles, which are reinforced by specific legislation such as the **Persons with Disabilities Act** and the **Children Act**. ### Conclusion: Private parties must ensure that their policies and practices do not discriminate against individuals with disabilities. This includes providing **reasonable accommodation**, **accrediting individuals with disabilities**, and **complying with legal and constitutional standards** that promote equality and non-discrimination. Failure to comply may result in **legal liability**, including **imprisonment** or **fines** under **section 9(2) of the Children Act**.","[""Persons with Disabilities Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Labour Relations Act"", ""Income Tax Act"", ""Children Act"", ""Tax Procedures Act""]","[""23 – Incentive for private employer - Incentive for private employer"", ""9 – General provision of contract of service - General provision of contract of service"", ""17 – Requirements for registering a federation of employers - Requirements for registering a federation of employers"", ""10 – Subject to section 26, the income of an institution, body of persons or irrevocable trust, of a public character established solely for the purposes of the relief of the poverty or distress of the public, or for the advancement of religion or education– - Subject to section 26, the income of an institution, body of persons or irrevocable trust, of a public character established solely for the purposes of the relief of the poverty or distress of the public, or for the advancement of religion or education–"", ""9 – Non-discrimination - Non-discrimination"", ""72 – Tax Compliance Certificate - Tax Compliance Certificate""]","[""(1) A private employer who engages a person with a disability either as a regular employee, apprentice or learner shall be entitled to apply for a deduction from its taxable income equivalent to twentyfive percent of the total amount paid as salary and wages to such employee: Provided that such an employer shall present proof certified by the Council of the person in respect of whom it claims the deduction and the person with disabilities so employed is accredited with the Council as to disabilities, skills and qualifications.

What remedies are available in relation to beneficiaries? on appeal,Fatal Accidents Act,Section 5,"The question regarding remedies available in relation to beneficiaries on appeal is not directly addressed in the provided context. However, based on the relevant legal provisions, the following can be inferred: - In the context of appeals, the **Tax Procedures Act, Section 56(2)** provides that an appeal to the High Court or Court of Appeal shall be on a question of law only. This means that the Court of Appeal will not consider factual disputes but will focus solely on legal issues. - If the appeal involves **beneficiaries**, such as in the context of **succession or inheritance**, the **Law of Succession Act, Section 28** outlines the circumstances to be considered by the court in making an order. These include the nature and amount of the deceased's property, the financial situation of the dependant, and other relevant factors. While this section does not directly address remedies on appeal, it indicates that the court may consider the interests of beneficiaries when determining the appropriate order. - In the context of **land charges**, **Land Act, Section 90** outlines the remedies available to a chargee, including the appointment of a receiver, leasing the land, or selling the land. If a beneficiary is affected by these remedies, they may seek relief from the court under **Land Act, Section 90(5)**, which allows the chargor to apply for relief against the remedies. In summary, while the context does not explicitly address remedies for beneficiaries on appeal, the available legal provisions suggest that the court may consider the interests of beneficiaries when determining the appropriate remedy, particularly in the context of succession or land charges. Any appeal would be limited to questions of law, and the court may grant relief if the remedies proposed would impose undue hardship on the beneficiaries.

How does one apply for relief concerning equality and freedom from discrimination? during investigations,Constitution of Kenya,Article 27,"To apply for relief concerning equality and freedom from discrimination during investigations, one may seek remedies through the courts under the **Constitution of Kenya, Article 23**, which grants the **High Court** original jurisdiction to hear and determine applications for redress of a denial, violation, or infringement of rights in the Bill of Rights.

What are the procedures for dealing with fair administrative action? for a claimant,Constitution of Kenya,Article 47,"The procedures for dealing with fair administrative action for a claimant are governed by Article 47 of the Constitution of Kenya and the Children Act. According to Article 47(2), if a right or fundamental freedom of a person has been or is likely to be adversely affected by administrative action, the person has the right to be given written reasons for the action. This principle of fair administrative action is also reflected in the Children Act, specifically in Section 76(2), which requires the Council to give written notice of the proposed deregistration of a child welfare programme and invite the programme to make its response within thirty days. If a person is aggrieved by the decision of the Council, they may appeal to the Cabinet Secretary, and if necessary, to the High Court. This process ensures that administrative decisions are subject to judicial review and that the affected parties have the opportunity to respond and challenge the decision. In addition, the Small Claims Court Act provides procedures for dealing with claims, including the filing of a statement of claim, the service of notice, and the possibility of obtaining a default judgment if the respondent fails to respond. These procedures ensure that claimants can pursue their claims effectively while adhering to the principles of fair administrative action. Thus, the procedures for dealing with fair administrative action for a claimant include the right to be given written reasons for administrative decisions, the opportunity to respond, and the right to appeal to higher authorities if the decision is adverse.

This ensures that employees are not deprived of their right to rest and leisure. 2. **Provision for Termination During Leave-Earning Period**: If employment is terminated after the completion of two or more consecutive months of service during any twelve-month leave-earning period, the employee is entitled to not less than one and three-quarter days of leave with full pay for each completed month of service, to be taken consecutively (Section 28(1)(b)). 3. **Division of Annual Leave**: An employer may divide the minimum annual leave entitlement into different parts to be taken at different intervals, provided that one part consists of at least two uninterrupted working weeks (Section 28(3)). This ensures that employees can plan their leave without losing the right to an uninterrupted period. 4. **Protection Against Forfeiture**: An employee cannot forfeit their annual leave entitlement on account of having taken maternity leave (Section 29(7)). This safeguard ensures that maternity leave does not impact the right to annual leave. 5. **Record Keeping**: Employers are required to keep a written record of an employee's annual leave entitlement, days taken, and days due (Section 74(1)(f)). This ensures transparency and accountability in the management of annual leave rights. These safeguards collectively ensure that employees' rights to annual leave are protected, upheld, and enforceable under Kenyan law.","[""Employment Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Data Protection Act"", ""Employment Act"", ""Employment Act""]","[""28 – Annual leave - Annual leave"", ""29 – Maternity leave - Maternity leave"", ""30 – Sick leave - Sick leave"", ""49 – Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya - Safeguards prior to transfer of personal data out of Kenya"", ""74 – Records to be kept by employer - Records to be kept by employer"", ""10 – Employment particulars - Employment particulars""]","[""(1) An employee shall be entitled— (a) after every twelve consecutive months of service with his employer to not less than twentyone working days of leave with full pay; (b) where employment is terminated after the completion of two or more consecutive months of service during any twelve months' leave-earning period, to not less than one and threequarter days of leave with full pay, in respect of each completed month of service in that period, to be taken consecutively.

What happens when hearing before termination arises? for a public authority,Employment Act,Section 41,"When a hearing before termination arises for an employee, the employer is required to explain the reasons for considering termination to the employee in a language the employee understands.

Furthermore, **Employment Act, section 41(2)** states that before terminating an employee's employment or summarily dismissing them, the employer must hear and consider any representations the employee or their chosen representative may make. This ensures that the employee has an opportunity to present their case and challenge the reasons for termination.

What remedies are available in relation to management of public land? on appeal,Land Act,Section 9,"The remedies available in relation to the management of public land, on appeal, are primarily governed by the **Land Act** and the **Constitution of Kenya, 2010**. While the context provided does not directly address remedies on appeal, it outlines the legal framework for the management of public land and the roles of various bodies, including the Commission and the Cabinet Secretary. Under **Section 10(3)** of the **Land Act**, the Commission must ensure that the guidelines for the management of public land comply with **Article 10(2) of the Constitution**, which guarantees the right to access and use land. This implies that any management plan or decision must be consistent with constitutional principles, and if a party believes these principles have been violated, they may seek remedies through the courts.

How is remedies of chargee handled under the law? in practice,Land Act,Section 80,"Under Kenyan law, the remedies of a chargee are governed by the **Land Act, 2016**, particularly **Section 90** and other relevant sections. Here is a concise legal summary: 1. **Notice of Default**: If a chargor defaults on their obligations under a charge, the chargee must serve a notice specifying the default, the required action to rectify it, and the time frame (not less than two months) for rectification. (Section 90(1)) 2. **Remedies Available**: If the default is not rectified within 90 days, the chargee may take various remedies, including suing the chargor for the money due, appointing a receiver, leasing or subleasing the land, entering into possession, or selling the land. (Section 90(3)) 3. **Court Intervention**: The chargor may apply to the court for relief against the chargee’s remedies. The court may grant relief if it is satisfied that the chargee has made all reasonable efforts to induce compliance, the chargor has persistently defaulted, and the sale of the land is necessary to recover the debt. (Section 103 and 104) 4. **Informal Charges**: An informal charge may be created by a written and witnessed undertaking, with the chargor depositing evidence of ownership. However, an informal chargee may only sell the land with a court order. (Section 79) 5. **Duty of the Chargee**: The chargee must ensure that the sale of the land is at a fair market value. If the land is sold at less than 25% below market value, the chargor may apply to the court to declare the sale void. (Section 97) 6. **Application for Relief**: The chargor may apply for relief at any time after the service of a notice or during the exercise of remedies. The application does not constitute an admission of breach or expiry of the notice period. (Section 103) In practice, the chargee must follow the procedures outlined in the Land Act, including serving notices, providing reasonable time for rectification, and seeking court approval for certain remedies, particularly in the case of informal charges and sales. The court plays a critical role in ensuring that the remedies are exercised fairly and in accordance with the law.","[""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act""]","[""90 – Remedies of a chargee - Remedies of a chargee"", ""91 – Chargee’s action for money secured by charge - Chargee’s action for money secured by charge"", ""104 – Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs - Power of the court in respect of remedies and reliefs"", ""79 – Informal charges - Informal charges"", ""97 – Duty of chargee exercising power of sale - Duty of chargee exercising power of sale"", ""103 – Application for relief by chargor - Application for relief by chargor""]","[""months, by the end of which the payment in default must have been completed; (c) if the default consists of the failure to perform or observe any covenant, express or implied, in the charge, the thing the chargor must do or desist from doing so as to rectify the default and the time, being not less than two months, by the end of which the default must have been rectified; (d) the consequence that if the default is not rectified within the time specified in the notice, the chargee will proceed to exercise any of the remedies referred to in this section in accordance with the procedures provided for in this sub-part; and (e) the right of the chargor in respect of certain remedies to apply to the court for relief against those remedies.

What are the requirements for compliance with oral evidence? for a private party,Evidence Act,Section 63,"To comply with the requirements for oral evidence in Kenyan law, a private party must ensure that all oral evidence is **direct** (Evidence Act, s. 63). This means that the evidence must directly relate to the fact in question and cannot be inferred or implied. Additionally, if the oral evidence concerns the existence or condition of a material thing (other than a document), the court may require the production of that thing for inspection (Evidence Act, s. 63(3)). If the oral evidence is given through teleconferencing or video conferencing, the court may accept it, provided that the Chief Justice has developed regulations governing such procedures (Evidence Act, s. 63A). Furthermore, if the oral evidence is used to contradict, vary, add to, or subtract from the terms of a document, it may only be admitted if the document's validity is in question (e.g., due to fraud, illegality, or lack of capacity), or if the oral evidence relates to a separate agreement not inconsistent with the document (Evidence Act, s. 98(3)(ii)). Finally, any oral admission regarding the contents of a document may not be admitted unless the party proposing the evidence has shown entitlement to secondary evidence of the document's contents, or the document's genuineness is in question (Evidence Act, s. 22). To impeach the credibility of a witness, the adverse party may rely on evidence of the witness's prior inconsistent statements, or evidence that the witness has accepted bribes or other corrupt inducements (Evidence Act, s. 163).","[""Evidence Act"", ""Law of Succession Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act""]","[""63 – Oral evidence must be direct. - Oral evidence must be direct."", ""10 – Proof of oral wills - Proof of oral wills"", ""98 – Evidence of oral agreement. - Evidence of oral agreement."", ""62 – Oral evidence. - Oral evidence."", ""22 – Oral admissions as to contents of documents. - Oral admissions as to contents of documents."", ""163 – Evidence to impeach the credit of a witness. - Evidence to impeach the credit of a witness.""]","[""an expert expressed in any treatise commonly offered for sale, and the grounds on which such opinion is held, may be proved by the production of such treatise if the author is dead or cannot be found, or has become incapable of giving evidence, or cannot be called as a witness without an amount of delay or expense which the court regards as unreasonable.

What documents are needed to address documentary evidence? at the application stage,Evidence Act,Section 65,"To address documentary evidence at the application stage, the following documents are typically required: 1. **Original Document**: Where possible, the original document should be produced for inspection by the court, as it constitutes primary evidence under **Evidence Act, Section 65(1)**. If the original is not available, a **certified copy** may be used, particularly if the original is a public document or falls under specific categories outlined in **Evidence Act, Section 68(1)(e) and (f)**. 2. **Certified Copy**: If the original document is not available or cannot be conveniently examined in court, a **certified copy** of the document may be admissible, especially if the original is a public document or if a certified copy is permitted by law. This is covered under **Evidence Act, Section 68(1)(e) and (f)**. 3. **Statement of the Maker**: If the maker of the statement is available, their testimony may be required to authenticate the document. However, if the maker is unavailable (e.g., dead, missing, or unable to attend), the statement may still be admissible under **Evidence Act, Section 35(1)**. 4. **Notice of Service**: If the statement is to be tendered in evidence under **Evidence Act, Section 20**, the document must be served on the other parties to the proceedings at least two days before the proceedings commence. Failure to serve the document may result in its inadmissibility. 5. **Notice to Accused (if applicable)**: If the document is to be used in a criminal case, the accused must be informed in writing that the statement will be tendered in evidence in lieu of the witness, unless they object. This is outlined in **Evidence Act, Section 20(5)**.

What timelines apply when dealing with secondary evidence? at the hearing stage,Evidence Act,Section 68,"When dealing with secondary evidence at the hearing stage, the timelines are not explicitly defined in the provided legal context. However, the following considerations apply: 1. **Notice to Produce**: Under **Evidence Act 69**, the party proposing to rely on secondary evidence must give the adverse party or their advocate notice to produce the original document. This notice is required unless certain exceptions apply, such as when the document itself is a notice, or when the adverse party has admitted the loss of the document. The timing of this notice is not specified, but it should be given sufficiently in advance to allow the adverse party to respond. 2. **Admissibility at Hearing**: Under **Evidence Act 144**, the court has discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence, including secondary evidence. If the court finds that the secondary evidence is admissible, it may be presented at the hearing. The court may also allow evidence to be taken at any time during the proceedings if additional evidence is required, as provided in **Criminal Procedure Code 358(1)**. In summary, while specific timelines are not outlined in the context, the notice requirement under **Evidence Act 69** and the court's discretion under **Evidence Act 144** and **Criminal Procedure Code 358** govern the use of secondary evidence at the hearing stage.","[""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act""]","[""66 – Secondary evidence. - Secondary evidence."", ""68 – Proof of documents by secondary evidence. - Proof of documents by secondary evidence."", ""69 – Notice to produce a document. - Notice to produce a document."", ""358 – Power to take further evidence - Power to take further evidence"", ""64 – Proof of contents of documents. - Proof of contents of documents."", ""144 – Court to decide as to the admissibility of evidence. - Court to decide as to the admissibility of evidence.""]","[""Secondary evidence includes— (a) certified copies given under the provisions hereinafter contained; (b) copies made from the original by mechanical processes which in themselves ensure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies; (c) copies made from or compared with the original; (d) counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute them; (e) oral accounts of the contents of a document given by some person who has himself seen it."", ""(1) Secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document in the following cases— (a) when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power of— (i) the person against whom the document is sought to be proved; or (ii) a person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the court; or (iii) any person legally bound to produce it, and when, after the notice required by section 69 of this Act has been given, such person refuses or fails to produce it; (b) when the existence, condition or contents of the original are proved to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved, or by his representative in interest; (c) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in a reasonable time; (d) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable; (e) when the original is a public document within the meaning of section 79 of this Act; (f) when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by this Act or by any written law to be"", ""Secondary evidence of the contents of the documents referred to in section 68(1)(a) of this Act shall not be given unless the party proposing to give such secondary evidence has previously given to the party in whose possession or power the document is, or to his advocate, such a notice to produce it as is required by law or such notice as the court considers reasonable in the circumstances of the case: Provided that such notice shall not be required in order to render secondary evidence admissible in any of the following cases— (i) when the document to be proved is itself a notice; (ii) when from the nature of the case, the adverse party must know that he will be required to produce it; (iii) when it appears or is proved that the adverse party has obtained possession of the original by fraud or force; (iv) when the adverse party or his agent has the original in court; (v) when the adverse party or his agent has admitted the loss of the document; (vi) when the person in possession of the document is out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the court; (vii) in any other case in which the court thinks fit to dispense with the requirement."", ""(1) In dealing with an appeal from a subordinate court, the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, shall record its reasons, and may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a subordinate court.

What remedies are available in relation to burden of proof? on appeal,Evidence Act,Section 107,"In relation to the burden of proof on appeal, the following remedies are available: 1. **Burden on the taxpayer**: In tax-related appeals, the burden of proving that a tax decision is incorrect lies on the taxpayer (Tax Procedures Act, section 56(1)). This means the taxpayer must provide evidence to show that the tax authority's decision was wrong. 2. **Appeal on a question of law only**: Appeals to the High Court or Court of Appeal are limited to questions of law only (Tax Procedures Act, section 56(2)). This means the factual burden does not shift to the court to prove the facts, but rather the appeal is confined to legal interpretation. 3. **Burden of proof in civil proceedings**: In civil proceedings under the Value Added Tax Act, the burden of proving that any tax has been paid or that goods/services are exempt from tax lies on the person liable to pay the tax or claiming exemption (Value Added Tax Act, section 62). 4. **Burden of proof in general**: Under the Evidence Act, the burden of proof lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in the existence of a particular fact, unless law provides otherwise (Evidence Act, section 107 and 109). On appeal, this principle continues to apply unless modified by specific statutory provisions. 5. **Reasonable doubt**: If the court is satisfied that the evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the accused may be acquitted (Evidence Act, section 111(1)). This principle may apply in criminal appeals where the burden of proof is on the prosecution. In summary, the burden of proof on appeal depends on the nature of the case, the applicable statute, and the principle that the burden rests on the party seeking to establish a fact or challenge a decision.","[""Evidence Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Tax Procedures Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Value Added Tax Act"", ""Evidence Act""]","[""107 – Burden of proof. - Burden of proof."", ""111 – Burden on accused in certain cases. - Burden on accused in certain cases."", ""56 – General provisions relating to objections and appeals - General provisions relating to objections and appeals"", ""109 – Proof of particular fact. - Proof of particular fact."", ""62 – Burden of proof - Burden of proof"", ""110 – Proof of admissibility. - Proof of admissibility.""]","[""(1) Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist.

How does one apply for relief concerning presumptions of fact? during investigations,Evidence Act,Section 119,"The application for relief concerning presumptions of fact during investigations is governed by the **Evidence Act**, specifically **Section 4(1)** and **Section 4(2)**, which outline the presumptions of fact and their admissibility in court. Under **Section 4(1)**, if a fact is provided by law to be presumed, the court may regard it as proved unless and until it is disproved. This means that during investigations, if a presumption of fact is established by law, the court may treat it as admitted unless evidence is presented to the contrary. **Section 4(2)** further clarifies that if a fact is directed by law to be presumed, the court shall regard it as proved unless disproved. This reinforces that during investigations, the presumption of fact is taken as a basis for the court's consideration, and the burden of proof lies with the party challenging the presumption. In addition, **Section 144(2)** of the **Evidence Act** provides that the court shall admit evidence of any fact if it thinks that the fact, if proved, would be admissible. This supports the admissibility of evidence based on presumptions of fact during investigations. Therefore, during investigations, if a presumption of fact is established by law, the court may treat it as admitted, and the burden of proof lies with the party challenging the presumption. The court's discretion in admitting evidence based on such presumptions is guided by **Section 144(2)**.","[""Evidence Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Evidence Act"", ""Land Act"", ""Income Tax Act""]","[""4 – Presumptions of fact. - Presumptions of fact."", ""103 – Application for relief by chargor - Application for relief by chargor"", ""42 – Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land - Relief against rescission of contract for the sale of land"", ""144 – Court to decide as to the admissibility of evidence. - Court to decide as to the admissibility of evidence."", ""155 – Unlawful occupation of land - Unlawful occupation of land"", ""31 – Insurance relief - Insurance relief""]","[""(1) Whenever it is provided by law that the court may presume a fact, it may either regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved, or may call for proof of it.

How is number of witnesses handled under the law? in practice,Evidence Act,Section 143,"Under Kenyan law, the number of witnesses required to prove a fact is not prescribed by statute, unless specifically provided for by law. This is set out in **Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) 211**, which states that no particular number of witnesses shall be required for the proof of any fact, unless otherwise provided by law. In practice, the court may adjourn the trial if the accused person states that they have witnesses who are not present in court, and the court is satisfied that the absence of those witnesses is not due to the fault or neglect of the accused, and that those witnesses could provide material evidence. In such cases, the court may issue process or take other steps to compel the attendance of the witnesses. Additionally, under **CPC 308**, the accused is allowed to examine any additional witness who is in attendance at the trial, even if that witness was not previously summoned. This provides flexibility in the number of witnesses that may be called during the trial. Therefore, while there is no fixed number of witnesses required, the court has discretion to adjourn the trial or take steps to ensure the attendance of witnesses who may provide material evidence.","[""Evidence Act"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Criminal Procedure Code"", ""Criminal Procedure Code""]","[""143 – Number of witnesses. - Number of witnesses."", ""211 – Defence - Defence"", ""308 – Additional witnesses for the defence - Additional witnesses for the defence"", ""3 – Trial of offences under Penal Code (Cap. 63) and under other laws - Trial of offences under Penal Code (Cap. 63) and under other laws"", ""23 – PREVIOUS CONVICTION - PREVIOUS CONVICTION"", ""366 – Number of judges in revision - Number of judges in revision""]","[""No particular number of witnesses shall, in the absence of any provision of law to the contrary, be required for the proof of any fact."", ""If the accused person states that he has witnesses to call but that they are not present in court, and the court is satisfied that the absence of those witnesses is not due to any fault or neglect of the accused person, and that there is a likelihood that they could, if present, give material evidence on behalf of the accused person, the court may adjourn the trial and issue process, or take other steps, to compel the attendance of the witnesses.
