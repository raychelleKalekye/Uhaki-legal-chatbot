If there are concerns about the adequacy of the investigation or the suitability of the adoption, the court may grant relief in the form of additional inquiries, reconsideration of the adoption order, or other protective measures. Relief may also be sought by the child, the parent, or any other qualified person under **Children Act, section 134(2)**, provided the application is made in the child's best interests. If the investigation reveals that the adoption is not in the child's best interests, the court may revoke the adoption order or grant joint custody, as outlined in **Children Act, section 190(1)-(3)**. In summary, relief concerning the powers of the court in adoption proceedings during investigations is sought through the court's authority to make orders under **Children Act, section 134**, with the guardian ad litem and other qualified persons playing key roles in ensuring the child's welfare."
