Relief may also be sought by the child, the parent, or any other qualified person under **Children Act, section 134(2)**, provided the application is made in the child's best interests. If the investigation reveals that the adoption is not in the child's best interests, the court may revoke the adoption order or grant joint custody, as outlined in **Children Act, section 190(1)-(3)**.
