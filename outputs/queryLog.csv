However, this section does not provide a general right to cancel a contract after signing. It only governs the validity of such contracts in legal proceedings. 2. **Employment Contracts**: - Under the **Employment Act** (Cap. 303), a contract of service must be in writing if it involves employment for a period or work that could not be completed within three months (s. 9). - A **labour officer** may cancel or prohibit a contract involving a child if it constitutes child labour or involves an undesirable employer (s. 55). - If an employment contract expires during a journey, the employer may extend the contract for up to one month to complete the journey (s. 39). 3. **Criminal Procedure Code**: The **High Court** may cancel a bond or order under certain circumstances, but this applies to specific legal orders rather than general contracts (s. 60). 4. **General Cancellation**: There is no general provision in Kenyan law that allows for the cancellation of any contract after signing. Cancellation typically requires a valid legal reason, such as breach of contract, illegality, or specific statutory provisions (e.g., those involving child labour or land transactions). In conclusion, whether a contract can be cancelled after signing depends on the specific legal provisions applicable to the contract and the circumstances surrounding its execution.
